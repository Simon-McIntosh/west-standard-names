description: Particle fueling rate from neutral beam injection system.
documentation: |-
  Neutral beam fueling rate representing the particle source rate from neutral beam injection (NBI) systems in magnetized plasmas. This fueling mechanism provides both particle injection and plasma heating through the deposition of high-energy neutral atoms that ionize and become trapped in the plasma. The fueling rate depends on beam current, species composition, and ionization efficiency, with different beam species providing varying fueling effectiveness. NBI fueling is essential for density control and plasma performance optimization in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Gamma_{fueling} = \sum_i \frac{I_{beam,i}}{e} \eta_{ionization,i} \eta_{trapping,i}$$

  where $\Gamma_{fueling}$ is the fueling rate, $I_{beam,i}$ is beam current for species i, $e$ is elementary charge, $\eta_{ionization,i}$ is ionization efficiency, and $\eta_{trapping,i}$ is trapping efficiency.

  Physical significance: Neutral beam fueling rate determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through particle balance and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for achieving proper density control and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles, [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through beam-driven current, and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through beam deposition patterns. Essential for [particle_balance](#particle_balance) and density profile control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Beam current monitors measure injected particle rates with high precision. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles for fueling efficiency analysis. NBI modeling codes calculate ionization and trapping efficiencies. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides complementary density validation. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: NBI fueling rate 2-5×10²¹ particles/s with deuterium beams. JET: 1-3×10²¹ particles/s depending on beam power. DIII-D: 5×10²⁰-2×10²¹ particles/s with various beam species. Higher fueling rates enable better density control but require careful particle balance management. Range across machines: 5×10²⁰-5×10²¹ particles/s.

  Sign convention: Positive fueling rate indicates particle injection into the plasma from external neutral beam sources.
