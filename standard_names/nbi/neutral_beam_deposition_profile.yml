description: Spatial deposition profile of neutral beam heating and fueling.
documentation: |-
  Neutral beam deposition profile representing the spatial distribution of heating power and particle source from neutral beam injection in magnetized plasmas. This profile determines the local heating efficiency and particle deposition characteristics of NBI systems, with deposition patterns depending on beam energy, magnetic field geometry, and plasma parameters. Understanding deposition profiles is crucial for optimizing NBI system performance and predicting plasma response in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{deposition}(r) = P_{NBI} \cdot S(r) \cdot \eta_{absorption}(r)$$

  where $P_{deposition}(r)$ is the deposition power at radius r, $P_{NBI}$ is total NBI power, $S(r)$ is the source function, and $\eta_{absorption}(r)$ is the absorption efficiency.

  Physical significance: Neutral beam deposition profile determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through localized heating and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for achieving optimal heating profiles and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) profiles, [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through localized current drive, and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through orbit effects. Essential for [heating_deposition](#heating_deposition) analysis and current profile control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: NBI modeling codes calculate deposition profiles based on beam geometry and plasma parameters. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures temperature profiles for deposition validation. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides complementary deposition analysis. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines beam orbit effects. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Deposition profiles peaked at r/a = 0.3-0.7 depending on beam energy and geometry. JET: Peak deposition at r/a = 0.2-0.6 for various beam configurations. DIII-D: Peak deposition at r/a = 0.1-0.5 with optimized beam angles. Deposition width typically 10-30% of minor radius. Range across machines: r/a = 0.1-0.7 depending on beam parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive deposition indicates power and particle input to the plasma at specific spatial locations, with profiles normalized to integrate to total injected power.
