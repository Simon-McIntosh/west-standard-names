  momentum.
documentation: |-
  Neutral beam current drive (NBCD) representing current drive mechanism using fast neutral atoms that ionize in plasma and deposit momentum along magnetic field lines. Provides both heating and current drive simultaneously, making it highly efficient for high-performance scenarios. Essential for tokamak heating and current drive in advanced operating modes. Critical for achieving high [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) in tokamak operation. NBCD efficiency depends on beam energy, species, and plasma parameters including [electron_density](#electron_density) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Key component of ITER heating and current drive systems for sustained high-performance operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{NBCD} = \frac{e n_b v_b^2}{E_b} \frac{P_{beam}}{v_b} \eta_{NB}$$

  where $j_{NBCD}$ is NBCD current density, $e$ is elementary charge, $n_b$ is beam particle density, $v_b$ is beam velocity, $E_b$ is beam energy, $P_{beam}$ is beam power, and $\eta_{NB}$ is NBCD efficiency.

  Physical significance: NBCD provides simultaneous heating and current drive for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and high-performance operation. Critical for achieving high [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) with reduced auxiliary power requirements. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics). Essential for advanced tokamak scenarios requiring high heating power and efficient current drive. Related to [current_drive](#current_drive) optimization and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) maintenance.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for NBCD efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines beam deposition and current drive profiles. NBCD codes calculate current drive efficiency and deposition based on beam physics and plasma parameters. [Fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) analysis tracks beam ion orbits and current drive effectiveness. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) control and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: NBCD efficiency $\eta_{NB} \approx 0.05-0.2$ A/W at 1 MeV, simultaneous heating and current drive. JET: $\eta_{NB} \approx 0.04-0.18$ A/W at 140 keV. DIII-D: $\eta_{NB} \approx 0.04-0.16$ A/W at 80 keV. Higher efficiency at elevated beam energy and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.04-0.2 A/W (mean ~0.1 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive NBCD drives current in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following tokamak current drive conventions.
