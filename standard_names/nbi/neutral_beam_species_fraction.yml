name: neutral_beam_species_fraction
description: Fractional composition of different species in neutral beam injection.
documentation: |-
  Neutral beam species fraction representing the relative composition of different atomic species in neutral beam injection systems for magnetized plasmas. This composition parameter determines both heating and fueling characteristics of NBI systems, with different species providing varying energy deposition profiles and particle source rates. Common beam species include hydrogen, deuterium, tritium, and helium, with fractional composition optimized for specific tokamak scenarios and operational requirements.

  Governing equation:
  $$f_i = \frac{n_{beam,i}}{\sum_j n_{beam,j}}$$

  where $f_i$ is the species fraction for species i, $n_{beam,i}$ is the beam density for species i, and the sum is over all beam species.

  Physical significance: Neutral beam species fraction determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through optimized heating and fueling and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Critical for achieving proper isotope ratios and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) through species-dependent heating, [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through beam-driven current, and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through deposition profiles. Essential for [particle_balance](#particle_balance) and isotope control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Mass spectrometry measures beam composition with high precision. NBI control systems monitor species fractions in real-time. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures isotope effects on plasma parameters. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) validates beam species effects. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: D:T fractions 50:50 for fusion studies, with H:D variations for heating optimization. JET: D:T fractions 50:50 or 80:20 for different experimental campaigns. DIII-D: H:D fractions 50:50 or 70:30 for various scenarios. Species fractions optimized for specific [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) requirements. Range: 0-100% for any species depending on operational needs.

  Sign convention: Positive when representing fractional abundance of each species in the beam composition, with values normalized to sum to unity.
