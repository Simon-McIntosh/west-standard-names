description: Total heating power delivered by neutral beam injection system.
documentation: |-
  Neutral beam heating power representing the total power delivered by neutral beam injection (NBI) systems to magnetized plasmas through collisional energy transfer from high-energy neutral atoms. This heating mechanism provides both bulk plasma heating and current drive through the deposition of energetic neutral atoms (typically 50-500 keV) that ionize and thermalize in the plasma. NBI is essential for achieving high-performance tokamak operation and provides direct heating independent of wave accessibility constraints.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{NBI} = \sum_i n_{beam,i} E_{beam,i} \sigma_{ionization,i} v_{beam,i} V_{plasma}$$

  where $P_{NBI}$ is neutral beam heating power, $n_{beam,i}$ is beam particle density for species i, $E_{beam,i}$ is beam energy, $\sigma_{ionization,i}$ is ionization cross-section, $v_{beam,i}$ is beam velocity, and $V_{plasma}$ is plasma volume.

  Physical significance: Neutral beam heating power determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through direct plasma heating and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for achieving high ion temperatures and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through beam-driven current, and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through beam deposition profiles. Essential for [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) and alpha particle heating studies.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Beam power monitors measure injected power with high precision. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures temperature profiles for heating efficiency analysis. NBI modeling codes calculate power deposition and heating profiles. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides complementary heating validation. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: NBI heating power 33-50 MW with beam energies 0.87-1.0 MeV. JET: 25-35 MW with beam energies 80-140 keV. DIII-D: 15-25 MW with beam energies 80-110 keV. Higher power enables better [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) but requires careful beam deposition management. Range across machines: 15-50 MW depending on machine size.

  Sign convention: Positive heating power indicates energy transfer from neutral beams to thermal plasma through ionization and thermalization processes.
