description: Bolometer radiated power measurement from plasma emission.
documentation: |-
  Bolometer radiated power measurement $P_{rad}$ from plasma emission, representing the total radiated power per unit area from plasma. Bolometry provides information about total radiation losses and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance).

  $$P_{rad} = \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{4\pi} j_{\nu}(\nu,\theta,\phi) \, d\Omega \, d\nu$$

  where $j_{\nu}$ is spectral emissivity and integration is over all directions and frequencies.

  Physical significance:

  Bolometer radiated power provides information about total radiation losses and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance). Radiation affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) and plasma sustainability. Bolometry is essential for [radiation_diagnostics](#radiation_diagnostics) and impurity analysis. See [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) for performance effects and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) for confinement analysis.

  Measurement relation:

  Radiated power relates to plasma parameters:

  $$P_{rad} = \sum_i n_e n_i Z_i^2 \Lambda_i(T_e)$$

  where $\Lambda_i$ is cooling rate coefficient for species $i$.

  Measurement methods:

  Bolometers use thermal detectors to measure total radiated power from plasma. Multiple chords provide spatial distribution of radiation. Absolute calibration uses known radiation sources. Time-resolved measurements study radiation dynamics. Abel inversion gives radial profiles.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected radiated powers of 10-100 MW/m^2 for typical plasma operations. JET: Typical powers 1-10 MW/m^2 for standard operations. DIII-D: Power ranges 0.1-5 MW/m^2 depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 2-5%.

  Sign convention: Positive radiated power indicates energy loss from plasma per unit area, following standard thermodynamics and energy conservation conventions.
