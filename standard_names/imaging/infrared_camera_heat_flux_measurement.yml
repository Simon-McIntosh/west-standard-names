description: Heat flux measurement from infrared camera diagnostic systems.
documentation: |-
  Infrared camera heat flux measurement representing heat flux values obtained from infrared imaging of plasma-facing components in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique measures infrared radiation from divertor targets and first wall components, providing direct measurements of heat loads and thermal response. Infrared cameras are essential for protecting plasma-facing materials and optimizing divertor performance in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$q = \epsilon \sigma (T^4 - T_{ambient}^4)$$

  where $q$ is heat flux, $\epsilon$ is emissivity, $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $T$ is surface temperature, and $T_{ambient}$ is ambient temperature.

  Physical significance: Infrared camera heat flux measurement determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through heat load monitoring and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) optimization. Critical for understanding [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) and material protection in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [imaging](#imaging) systems, [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through heat flux analysis. Essential for [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) control and material lifetime management.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Infrared cameras measure surface temperatures with high spatial resolution. [Imaging](#imaging) analysis converts temperatures to heat fluxes using material properties. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) modeling correlates heat fluxes with plasma parameters. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses heat flux data for divertor optimization. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: Heat flux measurements 5-20 MW/m² on divertor targets with spatial resolution 1-2 mm. JET: 3-15 MW/m² with resolution 0.5-1 mm. DIII-D: 2-10 MW/m² with high temporal resolution. Temperature precision typically 1-5°C depending on camera system. Range across machines: 2-20 MW/m².

  Sign convention: Positive when heat flux values indicate power flow from plasma to plasma-facing components through radiation and conduction.
