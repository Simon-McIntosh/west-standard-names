description: X-ray camera intensity measurement from plasma emission.
documentation: |-
  X-ray camera intensity $I_{X-ray}$ measurement from plasma emission, representing the spatial distribution of X-ray radiation from high-energy processes. X-ray imaging provides information about [fast_particles](#fast_particles), [runaway_electrons](#runaway_electrons), and high-temperature regions.

  $$I_{X-ray}(E,x,y) = \int n_e n_i Z_i^2 \sqrt{T_e} \exp\left(-\frac{E}{k_B T_e}\right) \, dl$$

  where $E$ is photon energy, $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $n_i$ is ion density, $Z_i$ is atomic number, and $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature).

  Physical significance:

  X-ray camera intensity provides information about [fast_particles](#fast_particles), [runaway_electrons](#runaway_electrons), and high-temperature plasma regions. X-ray emission indicates energetic particle populations and instabilities. X-ray imaging complement other diagnostics with high-energy physics information. See [fast_particles](#fast_particles) for energetic particles and [runaway_electrons](#runaway_electrons) for runaway physics.

  Measurement relation:

  X-ray intensity relates to plasma parameters:

  $$I_{X-ray} \propto n_e n_i Z_i^2 T_e^{-1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_{cutoff}}{k_B T_e}\right)$$

  where $E_{cutoff}$ is cutoff energy for X-ray emission.

  Measurement methods:

  X-ray cameras use semiconductor detectors or scintillators to measure high-energy radiation. Energy discrimination provides spectral information. Multiple viewing angles enable tomographic reconstruction. Time-resolved measurements study transient phenomena. Shielding protects detectors from neutron damage.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected X-ray intensities of 10^8-10^12 W/m^2 for typical plasma conditions. JET: Typical intensities 10^6-10^10 W/m^2 for standard operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^5-10^9 W/m^2 depending on plasma conditions. Energy ranges typically 1-100 keV.

  Sign convention: Positive X-ray intensity indicates measured power per unit area, following standard radiometry and high-energy physics conventions.
