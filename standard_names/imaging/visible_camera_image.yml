description: Visible light camera image from plasma observation.
documentation: |-
  Visible light camera image $I(x,y)$ from plasma observation, representing the spatial distribution of visible radiation emitted by plasma. Visible imaging provides information about plasma emission patterns, MHD activity, and plasma-wall interactions.

  $$I(x,y) = \int \epsilon_{visible}(x,y,z) \exp(-\tau(x,y,z)) \, dz$$

  where $\epsilon_{visible}$ is visible emissivity and $\tau$ is optical depth.

  Physical significance:

  Visible camera imaging provides spatial information about plasma emission patterns and MHD activity. Images show [mhd_instabilities](#mhd_instabilities), plasma position, and edge physics phenomena. Visible imaging complement spectroscopic measurements with spatial context. See [plasma_emission](#plasma_emission) for emission processes and [mhd_instabilities](#mhd_instabilities) for instability visualization.

  Measurement relation:

  Image intensity relates to plasma emission:

  $$I(x,y) \propto \int n_e n_i Z_{eff} T_e^{-1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T_e}\right) \, dz$$

  where $Z_{eff}$ is effective charge and $h\nu$ is photon energy.

  Measurement methods:

  Visible cameras use high-speed CCD or CMOS detectors to capture plasma emission. Multiple viewing angles provide tomographic reconstruction. Filtering removes specific spectral lines. Time-resolved imaging studies MHD dynamics. Calibration uses known light sources and geometric surveys.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected image intensities of 10^12-10^15 W/sr for typical plasma emission. JET: Typical intensities 10^10-10^13 W/sr for standard operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^9-10^12 W/sr depending on plasma conditions. Frame rates typically 1-1000 fps.

  Sign convention: Positive image intensity indicates measured power per unit solid angle, following standard imaging conventions and radiometry principles.
