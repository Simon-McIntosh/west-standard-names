description: Infrared camera temperature measurement from plasma-facing components.
documentation: |-
  Infrared camera temperature measurement $T_{IR}$ from plasma-facing components, representing the surface temperature distribution of divertor tiles and first wall. IR imaging provides information about heat flux distribution and plasma-wall interactions.

  $$T_{IR}(x,y) = \frac{hc}{\lambda k_B} \left[ \ln\left(\frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5 I(x,y)}\right) + 1 \right]$$

  where $I(x,y)$ is measured infrared intensity and $\lambda$ is central wavelength.

  Physical significance:

  Infrared camera temperature measurements provide information about heat flux distribution and plasma-wall interactions. Temperature patterns indicate [plasma_position](#plasma_position) and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) effects on wall loading. IR imaging is crucial for [wall_and_structures](#wall_and_structures) monitoring and protection. See [heat_flux](#heat_flux) for heat transfer and [plasma_wall_interactions](#plasma_wall_interactions) for interaction physics.

  Measurement relation:

  IR temperature relates to heat flux:

  $$q_{heat} = \epsilon \sigma (T_{IR}^4 - T_{ambient}^4)$$

  where $\epsilon$ is emissivity, $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $q_{heat}$ is heat flux.

  Measurement methods:

  Infrared cameras use thermal detectors to measure surface temperature distributions. Multiple wavelengths improve temperature accuracy. Emissivity calibration is essential for accurate measurements. Time-resolved imaging studies transient heat loads. Geometric correction accounts for viewing angles.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected IR temperatures of 300-2000°C for plasma-facing components during operation. JET: Typical temperatures 100-1500°C for standard operations. DIII-D: Temperature ranges 50-1000°C depending on plasma conditions. Temperature precision typically 1-5°C.

  Sign convention: Positive temperature indicates surface temperature above ambient, following standard thermodynamics and thermal measurement conventions.
