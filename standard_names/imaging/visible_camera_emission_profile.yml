description: Visible light emission profile from plasma imaging cameras.
documentation: |-
  Visible camera emission profile representing spatial distribution of visible light emissions from magnetized plasmas. This imaging diagnostic measures visible continuum and line emissions from plasma impurities, providing information on plasma position, shape, and impurity radiation patterns. Visible camera systems are essential for real-time plasma monitoring and disruption avoidance in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$I(x,y) = \int_0^L n_e(r) n_z(r) \langle \sigma v \rangle_{emission} \, dl$$

  where $I(x,y)$ is emission intensity, $n_e$ is electron density, $n_z$ is impurity density, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{emission}$ is emission rate coefficient, and $L$ is line-of-sight length.

  Physical significance: Visible camera emission profile determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through plasma monitoring and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control. Critical for understanding [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) and impurity radiation in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [imaging](#imaging) systems, [electron_density](#electron_density), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through emission analysis. Essential for [disruption-prediction](#disruption-prediction) and real-time control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: High-speed cameras measure visible emission with high spatial and temporal resolution. [Imaging](#imaging) analysis determines plasma position and shape. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary density validation. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses camera data for monitoring. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: Visible emission 400-700 nm with frame rates 1-10 kHz for disruption monitoring. JET: 350-800 nm with rates 0.5-5 kHz. DIII-D: 300-750 nm with high-speed capabilities. Spatial resolution typically 1-5 mm depending on camera configuration. Range across machines: 300-800 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive when emission intensities indicate visible light radiation from plasma impurities and continuum emission.
