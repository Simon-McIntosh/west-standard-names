description: Local electron temperature measurement from Thomson scattering diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering local measurement representing localized electron temperature values obtained from Thomson scattering systems in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique measures scattered laser light from plasma electrons, providing high-resolution local measurements of electron temperature. Thomson scattering is fundamental for understanding plasma profiles and transport in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = r_e^2 (\hat{e}_s \times \hat{e}_i)^2 \left( \frac{\omega_s}{\omega_i} \right)^2$$

  where $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$ is differential cross-section, $r_e$ is classical electron radius, $\hat{e}_s, \hat{e}_i$ are scattered and incident polarization vectors, $\omega_s, \omega_i$ are scattered and incident frequencies.

  Physical significance: Thomson scattering local measurement determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fundamental plasma parameters and directly affects [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction. Critical for understanding [transport](#transport) physics and profile evolution in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [thomson-scattering](#thomson-scattering) systems, [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), and [electron_density](#electron_density). Essential for [equilibrium-reconstruction](#equilibrium-reconstruction) and transport analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Laser scattering systems measure scattered light spectra with high precision. [Thomson-scattering](#thomson-scattering) analysis determines electron temperature from spectral analysis. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses Thomson data for equilibrium constraints. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses local measurements for profile studies. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Local temperature measurements 1-20 keV with spatial resolution 1-5 cm. JET: 0.5-15 keV with resolution 0.5-2 cm. DIII-D: 0.3-10 keV with high temporal resolution. Temperature precision typically 1-5%. Range across machines: 0.3-20 keV.

  Sign convention: Positive when temperature values indicate physical electron temperature in the plasma at specific measurement locations.
