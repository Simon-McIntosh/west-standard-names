description: Thomson scattering spectrum measurement.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering spectrum $S(k,\omega)$ measurement from laser scattering, representing the frequency distribution of scattered light due to electron thermal motion. Spectral analysis provides [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through Doppler broadening.

  $$S(k,\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{\omega^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

  where $\sigma = k \sqrt{k_B T_e / m_e}$ is Doppler width, $k$ is scattering wavevector, $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant, and $m_e$ is electron mass.

  Physical significance:

  Thomson scattering spectrum provides direct measurement of [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through thermal Doppler broadening. Spectral analysis gives information about electron velocity distribution and plasma temperature profiles. Scattering complement [interferometry](#interferometry) measurements with local temperature data. See [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature relationships and [doppler_broadening](#doppler_broadening) for spectral effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Spectral width relates to electron temperature:

  $$\Delta \lambda_{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2\ln 2} \frac{\lambda_0}{c} \sqrt{\frac{2k_B T_e}{m_e}}$$

  where $\lambda_0$ is laser wavelength and $c$ is speed of light.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering spectra are measured using high-resolution spectrometers with CCD detectors. Multiple wavelengths enable analysis of different scattering volumes. Spectral calibration uses known wavelength references. Data analysis fits spectra to obtain temperatures. Time-resolved measurements study temperature dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected spectral widths of 0.1-1 nm for electron temperatures 10-20 keV. JET: Typical widths 0.05-0.5 nm for temperatures 5-10 keV. DIII-D: Width ranges 0.01-0.1 nm depending on temperature. Spectral resolution typically 0.001 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive spectral intensity indicates measured photon flux at specific wavelengths, following standard spectroscopy conventions and optical physics.
