description: Thomson scattering spatial resolution measurement.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering spatial resolution $\Delta r$ measurement, representing the minimum resolvable distance between measurement volumes. Resolution determines the accuracy of profile measurements and fluctuation analysis.

  $$\Delta r = \sqrt{(\Delta r_{laser})^2 + (\Delta r_{collection})^2 + (\Delta r_{optics})^2}$$

  where $\Delta r_{laser}$ is laser beam waist, $\Delta r_{collection}$ is collection optics resolution, and $\Delta r_{optics}$ is imaging system resolution.

  Physical significance:

  Thomson scattering spatial resolution determines the accuracy of [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [electron_density](#electron_density) profile measurements. Higher resolution enables detection of steep gradients and fine-scale structures. Resolution affects [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) analysis and fluctuation studies. See [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature resolution and [electron_density](#electron_density) for density resolution.

  Measurement relation:

  Spatial resolution relates to measurement accuracy:

  $$\sigma_{profile} \propto \frac{\Delta r}{L_{gradient}}$$

  where $L_{gradient}$ is characteristic gradient scale length.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering resolution is characterized using test targets and known structures. Laser beam profiling measures beam waist and divergence. Collection optics are tested using resolution targets. Imaging system resolution is measured using standard patterns. Multiple techniques provide comprehensive resolution characterization.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected spatial resolution of 1-5 cm for core measurements, 2-10 cm for edge measurements. JET: Typical resolution 0.5-2 cm for standard operations. DIII-D: Resolution ranges 0.2-1 cm depending on configuration. Resolution precision typically 10%.

  Sign convention: Positive spatial resolution indicates the minimum resolvable distance, following standard optical resolution definitions and measurement conventions.
