description: Electron density profile from Thomson scattering.
documentation: |-
  Electron density profile $n_e(r)$ from Thomson scattering diagnostic, representing the spatial distribution of electron density across the plasma cross-section. Profile measurements provide essential information for plasma physics and transport analysis.

  $$n_e(r) = n_{e0} \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2\right)^{\alpha_n}$$

  where $n_{e0}$ is central density, $r$ is minor radius, $a$ is plasma radius, and $\alpha_n$ is density profile exponent.

  Physical significance:

  Electron density profile determines plasma conductivity and affects [plasma_current](#plasma_current) distribution. Density gradients drive [particle_transport](#particle_transport) and impurity accumulation. Profile measurements are crucial for [equilibrium_reconstruction](#equilibrium_reconstruction) and transport modeling. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for local values and [density_gradient](#density_gradient) for transport effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Density profile relates to particle transport:

  $$D_e \nabla^2 n_e = S_{particles} - \nabla \cdot \Gamma_e$$

  where $D_e$ is particle diffusivity, $S_{particles}$ is particle source, and $\Gamma_e$ is particle flux.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering measures density from scattered light intensity analysis. Multiple laser beams provide spatial coverage. Density calibration uses known scattering cross-sections. Profile analysis includes geometry corrections and volume averaging. Time-resolved profiles study particle transport dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected central densities 10^20-10^21 m^-3, edge densities 10^19-10^20 m^-3, profile exponents 0.5-1.5. JET: Typical central densities 5×10^19-2×10^20 m^-3. DIII-D: Central densities 10^19-10^20 m^-3 depending on operating conditions. Profile precision typically 3%.

  Sign convention: Positive density indicates number of electrons per unit volume, following standard particle density definitions and plasma physics conventions.
