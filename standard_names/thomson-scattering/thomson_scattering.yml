description: Diagnostic technique measuring electron temperature and density from
  scattered laser light.
documentation: Thomson scattering diagnostic measuring electron temperature and density
  from scattered laser light. Laser beam scattered by thermal electron motion provides
  local measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. Essential for core
  plasma profile measurements and transport analysis. Scattered light spectrum width
  gives electron temperature, intensity gives density. Critical diagnostic for tokamak
  operation and equilibrium reconstruction. Provides fundamental plasma parameters
  for all transport calculations.
