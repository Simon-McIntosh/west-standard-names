description: Thomson scattering intensity measurement.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering intensity $I_{TS}$ measurement from laser scattering off plasma electrons, representing the power scattered per unit solid angle per unit frequency. Scattering intensity is proportional to [electron_density](#electron_density) and provides information about plasma properties.

  $$I_{TS} = I_0 \frac{d\sigma_{TS}}{d\Omega} n_e \Delta l \frac{\Delta \Omega}{\pi}$$

  where $I_0$ is incident laser intensity, $d\sigma_{TS}/d\Omega$ is differential Thomson cross-section, $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $\Delta l$ is scattering length, and $\Delta \Omega$ is collection solid angle.

  Physical significance:

  Thomson scattering intensity provides direct measurement of [electron_density](#electron_density) through the scattering cross-section. Intensity analysis gives information about scattering geometry and collection efficiency. Scattering measurements complement other density diagnostics with high spatial resolution. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [scattered_light](#scattered_light) for optical processes.

  Measurement relation:

  Scattering intensity relates to electron density:

  $$I_{TS} \propto n_e$$

  where the proportionality constant includes geometric and optical factors.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering uses high-power lasers (typically Nd:YAG at 532 nm) to probe plasma electrons. Scattered light is collected with high-throughput optical systems. Spectral analysis gives temperature information through Doppler broadening. Multiple scattering volumes provide spatial profiling. Calibration uses Rayleigh scattering in known gases.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected scattering intensities of 10^-12-10^-9 W/sr for core plasma densities (10^20 m^-3). JET: Typical intensities 10^-13-10^-11 W/sr for high-density operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^-14-10^-12 W/sr depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5% for calibrated systems.

  Sign convention: Positive scattering intensity indicates measured light power in the collection solid angle, following standard optical measurement conventions.
