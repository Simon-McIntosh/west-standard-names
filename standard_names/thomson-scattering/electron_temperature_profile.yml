description: Electron temperature profile from Thomson scattering.
documentation: |-
  Electron temperature profile $T_e(r)$ from Thomson scattering diagnostic, representing the spatial distribution of electron temperature across the plasma cross-section. Profile measurements provide crucial information for transport analysis and plasma control.

  $$T_e(r) = T_{e0} \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2\right)^{\alpha_T}$$

  where $T_{e0}$ is central temperature, $r$ is minor radius, $a$ is plasma radius, and $\alpha_T$ is profile exponent.

  Physical significance:

  Electron temperature profile determines plasma pressure and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and confinement quality. Temperature gradients drive [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) and heat flux calculations. Profile measurements are essential for [transport_modeling](#transport_modeling) and equilibrium reconstruction. See [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for local values and [temperature_gradient](#temperature_gradient) for transport effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Temperature profile relates to transport and heating:

  $$\chi_e \nabla^2 T_e = S_{heat} - \nabla \cdot q_e$$

  where $\chi_e$ is electron heat diffusivity, $S_{heat}$ is heating source, and $q_e$ is heat flux.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering systems measure temperature at multiple spatial locations simultaneously. Laser beams are imaged through different plasma chords. Multiple scattering volumes provide radial coverage. Profile analysis includes averaging and smoothing techniques. Time-resolved profiles study transport dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected central temperatures 10-20 keV, edge temperatures 1-2 keV, profile exponents 1-2. JET: Typical central temperatures 5-10 keV, edge 1-3 keV. DIII-D: Central temperatures 2-5 keV, edge 0.5-1 keV depending on heating power. Profile precision typically 5%.

  Sign convention: Positive temperature indicates thermal energy per particle, following standard thermodynamics conventions and plasma physics definitions.
