description: Collective Thomson scattering effects measurement.
documentation: |-
  Collective Thomson scattering effects measurement, representing enhanced scattering due to electron plasma waves and ion acoustic fluctuations. Collective scattering provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) fluctuations and [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) processes.

  $$S_{collective}(k,\omega) = S_{thermal}(k,\omega) \left[1 + \frac{\Delta \omega_{plasma}}{\Delta \omega_{thermal}}\right]$$

  where $S_{thermal}$ is thermal scattering, $\Delta \omega_{plasma}$ is plasma wave frequency shift, and $\Delta \omega_{thermal}$ is thermal Doppler width.

  Physical significance:

  Collective Thomson scattering detects electron plasma waves and ion acoustic fluctuations, providing information about [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) and microinstabilities. Enhanced scattering indicates wave activity and fluctuation levels. Collective effects complement thermal scattering with fluctuation sensitivity. See [turbulence](#turbulence) for fluctuation analysis and [plasma_waves](#plasma_waves) for wave physics.

  Measurement relation:

  Collective scattering relates to fluctuation levels:

  $$\frac{\Delta I_{collective}}{I_{thermal}} \propto \frac{\langle |\delta n_e|^2 \rangle}{n_e^2}$$

  where $\langle |\delta n_e|^2 \rangle$ is density fluctuation power.

  Measurement methods:

  Collective Thomson scattering uses forward scattering geometry to enhance plasma wave sensitivity. High spectral resolution enables detection of frequency shifts. Multiple scattering angles probe different wavenumbers. Analysis includes thermal background subtraction. Time-resolved measurements study fluctuation dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected collective enhancement factors of 1.1-10 for typical fluctuation levels. JET: Typical enhancement 1.05-5 for standard operations. DIII-D: Enhancement ranges 1.01-3 depending on turbulence levels. Measurement precision typically 10% for collective effects.

  Sign convention: Positive collective enhancement indicates increased scattering due to plasma fluctuations, following standard scattering physics and wave-plasma interaction theory.
