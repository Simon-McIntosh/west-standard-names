description: Thomson scattering fluctuation spectrum measurement.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering fluctuation spectrum $P(f)$ measurement, representing the frequency distribution of electron density fluctuations. Spectral analysis provides information about [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) and microturbulence characteristics.

  $$P(f) = \int S(k,\omega) \, dk = \int \frac{\langle |\delta n_e(k,f)|^2 \rangle}{n_e^2} \, dk$$

  where $S(k,\omega)$ is dynamic structure function, $\delta n_e(k,f)$ is density fluctuation in wavenumber-frequency space, and $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density).

  Physical significance:

  Thomson scattering fluctuation spectra provide direct measurement of [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) characteristics and microturbulence properties. Spectral analysis gives information about fluctuation levels, frequencies, and wavenumbers. Fluctuation measurements are essential for transport modeling and stability analysis. See [turbulence](#turbulence) for fluctuation physics and [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) for transport effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Fluctuation spectrum relates to transport coefficients:

  $$D_{turbulent} = \int \frac{P(k)}{k^2} \, dk$$

  where $P(k)$ is wavenumber spectrum and $D_{turbulent}$ is turbulent diffusivity.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering fluctuation spectra are measured using high-time-resolution detection systems. Multiple scattering volumes enable wavenumber analysis. Spectral analysis uses Fourier transform techniques. Time-series analysis gives frequency information. Cross-correlation between volumes provides wavenumber resolution.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected fluctuation levels of 0.1-10% of mean density, frequency ranges 1-100 kHz. JET: Typical fluctuation levels 0.05-5% for standard operations. DIII-D: Fluctuation ranges 0.01-1% depending on plasma conditions. Spectral resolution typically 1 kHz.

  Sign convention: Positive fluctuation power indicates density variation amplitude, following standard spectral analysis conventions and turbulence physics definitions.
