description: Thomson scattering system calibration factor.
documentation: |-
  Thomson scattering system calibration factor $C_{TS}$ representing the proportionality constant between measured signal and physical quantities. Calibration ensures accurate [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) measurements.

  $$C_{TS} = \frac{I_{measured}}{n_e \sigma_{TS} \Delta \Omega \Delta l \eta_{optical}}$$

  where $I_{measured}$ is measured intensity, $\sigma_{TS}$ is Thomson cross-section, $\Delta \Omega$ is collection solid angle, $\Delta l$ is scattering length, and $\eta_{optical}$ is optical efficiency.

  Physical significance:

  Thomson scattering calibration ensures accurate [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) measurements through system characterization. Calibration factors account for optical efficiency, geometric factors, and detector response. Regular calibration maintains measurement accuracy and traceability. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density calibration and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature calibration.

  Measurement relation:

  Calibration factor relates to system parameters:

  $$C_{TS} = \eta_{quantum} \times \eta_{collection} \times G_{electronics}$$

  where $\eta_{quantum}$ is quantum efficiency, $\eta_{collection}$ is collection efficiency, and $G_{electronics}$ is electronic gain.

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering calibration uses Rayleigh scattering in known gases (typically nitrogen or argon). Known density targets provide absolute calibration. Optical efficiency is measured using calibrated light sources. Detector response is characterized using reference standards. Regular calibration maintains measurement accuracy.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected calibration factors of 10^12-10^15 depending on system configuration. JET: Typical factors 10^11-10^14 for standard systems. DIII-D: Calibration ranges 10^10-10^13 depending on setup. Calibration precision typically 2%.

  Sign convention: Positive calibration factor indicates system sensitivity to scattered light, following standard calibration procedures and metrology conventions.
