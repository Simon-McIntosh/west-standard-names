description: Gas flow rate measured at the exit of a gas injection valve.
documentation: |-
  Gas flow rate $Q$ at the exit of a gas injection valve, measured in pressure-volume per unit time (Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹), representing the product of pressure and volumetric flow rate for gas injection systems in fusion devices. This measurement characterizes the instantaneous gas delivery rate from valve systems connecting gas bottles to injection pipes, essential for plasma fueling, density control, and disruption mitigation.

  Governing equation:
  $$Q = \frac{d}{dt}(PV) = P\frac{dV}{dt} + V\frac{dP}{dt}$$

  where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, and the unit Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ = N⋅m⁻²⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ = N⋅m⋅s⁻¹ = J⋅s⁻¹ = W.

  Physical significance: Gas injection flow rate determines [plasma_density](#plasma_density) control and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through density feedback systems. Critical for achieving optimal [collisionality](#collisionality) and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) in tokamak operation. Flow rate control enables disruption mitigation through massive gas injection (MGI). Related to [fueling](#fueling) efficiency and [particle_balance](#particle_balance) in plasma scenarios. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control and operational stability.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Pressure transducers and flow meters provide real-time flow rate measurements. Calibrated valve systems ensure accurate gas delivery. Mass flow controllers regulate injection rates. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures density responses to flow control. Integration with plasma control systems enables automated density feedback.

  Typical values: ITER: Flow rates 0.1-100 Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ for density control, up to 1000 Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ for disruption mitigation. JET: 0.05-50 Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ for standard operation. DIII-D: 0.01-20 Pa⋅m³⋅s⁻¹ depending on plasma conditions and control requirements.

  Sign convention: Positive flow rate indicates gas injection into the plasma region, with conversion to particle flux given by $\Gamma = \frac{Q}{k_B T}$ where $T$ is gas temperature.
