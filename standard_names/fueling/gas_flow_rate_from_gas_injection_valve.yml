description: Gas flow rate measured at the exit of a gas injection valve.
documentation: "Gas flow rate at the exit of a gas injection valve, measured in pressure-volume\
  \ per unit time (Pa\u22C5m\xB3\u22C5s\u207B\xB9). This unit represents the product\
  \ of pressure and volumetric flow rate, commonly used for gas injection systems\
  \ in fusion devices.\n\nThe measurement characterizes the instantaneous gas delivery\
  \ rate from valve systems connecting gas bottles to injection pipes. Flow rate is\
  \ time-dependent and controlled by valve actuation. Typical applications include\
  \ fueling, puffing for density control, and disruption mitigation gas injection.\n\
  \nThe unit Pa\u22C5m\xB3\u22C5s\u207B\xB9 = N\u22C5m\u207B\xB2\u22C5m\xB3\u22C5\
  s\u207B\xB9 = N\u22C5m\u22C5s\u207B\xB9 = J\u22C5s\u207B\xB9 = W, equivalent to\
  \ power. This reflects the work rate of gas injection against plasma pressure. Conversion\
  \ to particle flux requires temperature: $\\Gamma = \\frac{Q}{k_B T}$ where Q is\
  \ this flow rate, T is gas temperature, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant."
