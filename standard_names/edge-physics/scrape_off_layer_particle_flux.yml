description: Particle flux in the scrape-off layer of tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Scrape-off layer particle flux representing the radial particle transport across the last closed flux surface to the scrape-off layer in magnetized plasmas. This flux determines particle exhaust and recycling characteristics in tokamak operation, affecting density control and plasma-wall interaction. The particle flux is driven by turbulent transport and classical losses, making it crucial for understanding edge physics and optimizing plasma performance.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Gamma_{SOL} = -D_{\perp} \frac{dn}{dr} + \Gamma_{classical}$$

  where $\Gamma_{SOL}$ is SOL particle flux, $D_{\perp}$ is perpendicular diffusion coefficient, $dn/dr$ is density gradient, and $\Gamma_{classical}$ is classical loss term.

  Physical significance: Scrape-off layer particle flux determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through particle balance and directly affects [scrape_off_layer](#scrape_off_layer) transport in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [particle_balance](#particle_balance) and density control in edge physics scenarios. Strongly coupled to [edge-physics](#edge-physics), [transport](#transport), and [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) through particle exhaust mechanisms. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and density management.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures density gradients for flux calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines SOL geometry. SOL modeling codes calculate particle fluxes based on transport coefficients. [Plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) analysis uses flux data for recycling studies. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: SOL particle flux 1×10²⁰ - 1×10²² m⁻²s⁻¹ with connection lengths 10-50 m. JET: 5×10¹⁹ - 5×10²¹ m⁻²s⁻¹ with 5-30 m connection. DIII-D: 1×10¹⁹ - 1×10²¹ m⁻²s⁻¹ with 3-20 m connection. Flux scales with plasma conditions and transport properties. Range across machines: 10¹⁹-10²² m⁻²s⁻¹.

  Sign convention: Positive when particle flux indicates outward transport from confined plasma to scrape-off layer along open field lines.
