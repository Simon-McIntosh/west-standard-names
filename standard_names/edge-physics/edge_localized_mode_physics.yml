description: Physics of edge localized modes in H-mode tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Edge localized mode (ELM) physics representing the dynamics of periodic instabilities at the plasma edge in high confinement mode (H-mode) operation of magnetized plasmas. These instabilities cause periodic bursts of particles and energy from the edge pedestal to the scrape-off layer, providing both benefits (impurity removal) and challenges (heat load on plasma-facing components) for tokamak operation. Understanding ELM physics is crucial for optimizing H-mode performance and protecting plasma-facing materials.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dW}{dt} = \gamma_{ELM} W - \frac{W}{\tau_{ELM}}$$

  where $W$ is ELM energy, $\gamma_{ELM}$ is ELM growth rate, and $\tau_{ELM}$ is ELM timescale.

  Physical significance: Edge localized mode physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through H-mode optimization and directly affects [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) stability in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) in H-mode scenarios. Strongly coupled to [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) pressure gradients, [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [collisionality](#collisionality). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and divertor protection.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures edge profiles during ELM cycles. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines ELM stability boundaries. ELM modeling codes calculate growth rates and energy losses. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis uses ELM parameters for heat load predictions. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: ELM frequencies 0.1-10 Hz with energy losses 1-10 MJ per ELM. JET: 0.5-50 Hz with losses 0.1-5 MJ. DIII-D: 1-100 Hz with losses 0.01-1 MJ. ELM size typically 1-10% of pedestal energy. Range across machines: 0.1-100 Hz frequency.

  Sign convention: Positive when ELM energy losses indicate periodic particle and energy release from edge pedestal to scrape-off layer.
