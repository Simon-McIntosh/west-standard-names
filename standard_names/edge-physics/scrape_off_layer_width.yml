description: Characteristic width of scrape-off layer in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Scrape-off layer width representing the characteristic radial extent of the open field line region outside the last closed flux surface in magnetized plasmas. This width parameter determines the connection length between the confined plasma and plasma-facing components, affecting particle and energy exhaust in tokamak operation. The SOL width is crucial for understanding plasma-wall interaction and optimizing divertor performance.

  Governing equation:
  $$\lambda_q = \frac{qR}{\pi B_\theta} \sqrt{\frac{\chi_{\perp}}{\chi_{\parallel}}}$$

  where $\lambda_q$ is SOL width, $q$ is safety factor, $R$ is major radius, $B_\theta$ is poloidal field, $\chi_{\perp}$ and $\chi_{\parallel}$ are perpendicular and parallel transport coefficients.

  Physical significance: Scrape-off layer width determines [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) characteristics and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) performance in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [scrape_off_layer](#scrape_off_layer) transport and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through exhaust capabilities. Strongly coupled to [edge-physics](#edge-physics), [transport](#transport), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through transport physics. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and divertor optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures SOL profiles for width determination. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines SOL geometry. SOL modeling codes calculate width based on transport coefficients. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis uses width data for exhaust modeling. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: SOL width 2-5 mm for heat flux, connection length 10-50 m. JET: 1-3 mm width, 5-30 m connection. DIII-D: 0.5-2 mm width, 3-20 m connection. Width scales with machine size and transport properties. Range across machines: 0.5-5 mm.

  Sign convention: Positive when SOL width indicates radial extent of open field line region from last closed flux surface to material boundaries.
