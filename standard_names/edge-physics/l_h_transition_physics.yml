description: Physics of transition from L-mode to H-mode confinement in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  L-H transition physics representing the fundamental change in plasma confinement from low confinement (L-mode) to high confinement (H-mode) in magnetized plasmas. This transition is characterized by the formation of an edge transport barrier that reduces turbulence and improves confinement, leading to better plasma performance. The L-H transition is triggered when the power flow across the edge exceeds a critical threshold, making it essential for tokamak operation optimization.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{crit} = n_e T_e \chi_{\perp} \frac{B_T}{R}$$

  where $P_{crit}$ is critical power for L-H transition, $n_e$ is electron density, $T_e$ is electron temperature, $\chi_{\perp}$ is perpendicular transport coefficient, $B_T$ is toroidal field, and $R$ is major radius.

  Physical significance: L-H transition physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through confinement improvement and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for understanding [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) formation and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) in H-mode operation. Strongly coupled to [edge-physics](#edge-physics), [turbulence](#turbulence), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through transport barrier physics. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational planning.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures edge parameters during transition. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines transport barrier structure. L-H transition modeling codes calculate critical power thresholds. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses transition data for scenario optimization. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Critical power 50-150 MW for L-H transition at 5.3 T, 1×10²⁰ m⁻³. JET: 15-40 MW at 3.45 T, 8×10¹⁹ m⁻³. DIII-D: 2-8 MW at 2.2 T, 6×10¹⁹ m⁻³. Transition time typically 1-100 ms. Range across machines: 2-150 MW critical power.

  Sign convention: Positive when transition power indicates threshold for improved confinement through edge transport barrier formation.
