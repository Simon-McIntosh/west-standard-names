description: Physics of X-point configuration in tokamak divertor geometry.
documentation: |-
  X-point physics representing the magnetic topology and plasma behavior at the X-point in tokamak divertor configurations. The X-point is where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, creating a magnetic null that separates the confined plasma from the scrape-off layer. Understanding X-point physics is crucial for optimizing divertor performance and controlling plasma-wall interaction in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla \psi = 0$$

  where $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field and $\psi$ is poloidal flux.

  Physical significance: X-point physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through divertor optimization and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) and plasma control in divertor scenarios. Strongly coupled to [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [edge-physics](#edge-physics) through magnetic topology. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and divertor control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines X-point location and topology. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures plasma parameters near X-point. X-point modeling codes calculate magnetic topology effects. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis uses X-point data for divertor optimization. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: X-point height 0.5-1.5 m below midplane, radial position 4-6 m from center. JET: Height 0.2-0.8 m, radial position 2.5-3.5 m. DIII-D: Height 0.1-0.5 m, radial position 1.2-2.0 m. X-point accuracy typically 1-5 cm for control systems. Range across machines: varies with machine size.

  Sign convention: Positive when X-point parameters indicate magnetic null location and divertor configuration geometry.
