description: Region of steep pressure gradients at plasma edge in H-mode with improved
  confinement.
documentation: |-
  Edge pedestal representing region of steep pressure gradients at plasma edge in H-mode operation, characterized by improved confinement and reduced edge turbulence compared to L-mode. The pedestal forms naturally in high confinement mode and represents a transition region between the well-confined core plasma and the open field line scrape-off layer. Critical for H-mode performance and fusion gain in tokamak operation, with pedestal height and width directly determining core performance and stability.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{\partial p}{\partial \psi} = \frac{p_{ped} - p_{SOL}}{\Delta\psi_{ped}}$$

  where $p_{ped}$ is pedestal top pressure, $p_{SOL}$ is scrape-off layer pressure, and $\Delta\psi_{ped}$ is pedestal width in flux coordinate space.

  Physical significance: The edge pedestal determines [H_mode](#H_mode) performance and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through improved confinement properties. Critical for understanding [edge_localized_modes](#edge_localized_modes) (ELMs) and their impact on plasma operation. Strongly coupled to [safety_factor](#safety_factor), [collisionality](#collisionality), and [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through pressure gradient effects. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and fusion gain enhancement.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures pedestal profiles and gradients. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines pedestal structure. Edge transport modeling codes calculate pedestal formation and evolution. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses pedestal parameters for confinement predictions.

  Typical values: ITER: Pedestal height 20-50 kPa, width 5-15% of minor radius. JET: Height 10-40 kPa, width 3-12%. DIII-D: Height 8-35 kPa, width 4-10%. Higher pedestals enable better core performance but increase ELM stress.

  Sign convention: Positive when pressure increases toward plasma core within pedestal region.
