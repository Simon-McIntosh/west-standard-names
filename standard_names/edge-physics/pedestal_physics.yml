description: Physics of edge pedestal formation and stability in H-mode tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Pedestal physics representing the formation and stability characteristics of the edge transport barrier in high confinement mode (H-mode) operation of magnetized plasmas. The pedestal is characterized by steep pressure gradients at the plasma edge that improve confinement and determine H-mode performance. Understanding pedestal physics is crucial for optimizing tokamak performance and predicting stability limits in H-mode operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{\partial p}{\partial \psi} = \frac{p_{ped} - p_{SOL}}{\Delta\psi_{ped}}$$

  where $p_{ped}$ is pedestal top pressure, $p_{SOL}$ is scrape-off layer pressure, and $\Delta\psi_{ped}$ is pedestal width in flux coordinate space.

  Physical significance: Pedestal physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through H-mode optimization and directly affects [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) stability in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and [edge_localized_modes](#edge_localized_modes) in H-mode scenarios. Strongly coupled to [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) pressure gradients, [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [collisionality](#collisionality). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and fusion gain enhancement.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures pedestal profiles and gradients. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines pedestal structure. Pedestal modeling codes calculate formation and stability. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses pedestal parameters for confinement predictions. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: Pedestal height 20-50 kPa, width 5-15% of minor radius, pressure gradient 50-200 kPa/m. JET: Height 10-40 kPa, width 3-12%, gradient 30-150 kPa/m. DIII-D: Height 8-35 kPa, width 4-10%, gradient 20-100 kPa/m. Higher pedestals enable better core performance. Range across machines: 8-50 kPa height.

  Sign convention: Positive when pedestal parameters indicate pressure gradient strength and confinement improvement in H-mode operation.
