  to divertor.
documentation: |-
  Scrape-off layer (SOL) representing open field line region outside last closed flux surface with direct connection to divertor target plates in tokamak magnetic geometry. This critical plasma region extends from the last closed flux surface to the first wall, where magnetic field lines are not closed but instead intersect material surfaces. The SOL is essential for plasma-wall interaction and particle/energy exhaust in tokamak operation, providing the pathway for heat and particle removal from the confined plasma.

  Governing equation:
  $$\lambda_q = \frac{qR}{\pi B_\theta} \sqrt{\frac{\chi_{\perp}}{\chi_{\parallel}}}$$

  where $\lambda_q$ is the SOL width, $q$ is safety factor, $R$ is major radius, $B_\theta$ is poloidal field, $\chi_{\perp}$ and $\chi_{\parallel}$ are perpendicular and parallel transport coefficients.

  Physical significance: The SOL determines [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) physics and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) performance in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding edge transport and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through power exhaust capabilities. Strongly coupled to [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) physics and [collisionality](#collisionality) through transport mechanisms. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational limits in all tokamak devices.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures SOL profiles and transport properties. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines SOL geometry and field line connections. Edge plasma modeling codes calculate SOL width and transport. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis uses SOL parameters for exhaust modeling. Critical for understanding plasma-material interaction.

  Typical values: ITER: SOL width $\lambda_q$ = 2-5 mm, connection length 10-50 m. JET: $\lambda_q$ = 1-3 mm, connection length 5-30 m. DIII-D: $\lambda_q$ = 0.5-2 mm, connection length 3-20 m. Width scales with machine size and transport properties.

  Sign convention: Positive when extending outward from last closed flux surface toward material boundaries.
