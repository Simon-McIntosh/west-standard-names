name: scrape_off_layer_energy_flux
description: Energy flux in the scrape-off layer of tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Scrape-off layer energy flux representing the radial energy transport across the last closed flux surface to the scrape-off layer in magnetized plasmas. This flux determines heat exhaust and energy loss characteristics in tokamak operation, affecting plasma performance and plasma-facing component loading. The energy flux is crucial for understanding edge transport and optimizing divertor performance.

  Governing equation:
  $$q_{SOL} = -\chi_{\perp} \frac{dT}{dr} + q_{convective}$$

  where $q_{SOL}$ is SOL energy flux, $\chi_{\perp}$ is perpendicular thermal diffusivity, $dT/dr$ is temperature gradient, and $q_{convective}$ is convective energy flux.

  Physical significance: Scrape-off layer energy flux determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through energy balance and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) performance in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [energy_balance](#energy_balance) and heat exhaust in edge physics scenarios. Strongly coupled to [edge-physics](#edge-physics), [transport](#transport), and [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) through heat transport mechanisms. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and heat load management.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures temperature gradients for flux calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines SOL geometry. SOL modeling codes calculate energy fluxes based on transport coefficients. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis uses flux data for heat load predictions. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: SOL energy flux 0.1-1 GW/m² with connection lengths 10-50 m. JET: 0.05-0.5 GW/m² with 5-30 m connection. DIII-D: 0.01-0.2 GW/m² with 3-20 m connection. Flux scales with plasma heating and transport properties. Range across machines: 0.01-1 GW/m².

  Sign convention: Positive when energy flux indicates outward heat transport from confined plasma to scrape-off layer along open field lines.
