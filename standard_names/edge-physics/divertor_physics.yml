description: Physics of plasma exhaust and interaction with divertor target plates.
documentation: |-
  Divertor physics describing plasma exhaust and interaction with divertor target plates in tokamak magnetic configurations, representing the critical region for particle and energy removal from the confined plasma. The divertor uses magnetic geometry to direct plasma heat and particles to specialized target plates, protecting the main chamber walls from excessive heat loads. Essential for understanding plasma-wall interaction and material erosion in tokamak operation, with divertor configuration directly affecting confinement, stability, and material performance.

  Governing equation:
  $$q_{\parallel} = n_e T_e v_{\parallel} = \frac{P_{div}}{\pi a R}$$

  where $q_{\parallel}$ is parallel heat flux, $n_e$ is electron density, $T_e$ is electron temperature, $v_{\parallel}$ is parallel velocity, $P_{div}$ is divertor power, $a$ is minor radius, and $R$ is major radius.

  Physical significance: Divertor physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through power exhaust capabilities and directly affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) sustainability. Critical for achieving acceptable divertor loading and lifetime in ITER and future tokamak design. Strongly coupled to [scrape_off_layer](#scrape_off_layer) transport and [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) physics through exhaust pathways. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational limits.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures divertor plasma parameters. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines divertor geometry and field line connections. Divertor modeling codes calculate heat and particle loads. [Plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) analysis uses divertor parameters for material response modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: Divertor heat flux 10-20 MW/m², target temperature 500-1000°C. JET: Heat flux 5-15 MW/m², target temperature 300-800°C. DIII-D: Heat flux 3-10 MW/m², target temperature 200-600°C. Heat flux distribution depends on magnetic configuration.

  Sign convention: Positive when heat flux flows toward divertor target plates along magnetic field lines.
