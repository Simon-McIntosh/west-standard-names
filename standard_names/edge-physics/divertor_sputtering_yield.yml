description: Sputtering yield from divertor target material under plasma bombardment.
documentation: |-
  Divertor sputtering yield representing the number of atoms ejected per incident ion from divertor target materials under plasma bombardment in magnetized plasmas. This yield determines material erosion rates and impurity generation in tokamak operation, affecting plasma performance and component lifetime. The sputtering yield depends on incident ion energy, angle, species, and target material properties, making it crucial for plasma-wall interaction studies.

  Governing equation:
  $$Y = \frac{N_{sputtered}}{N_{incident}} = f(E_i, \theta, Z_i, Z_t)$$

  where $Y$ is sputtering yield, $N_{sputtered}$ is number of sputtered atoms, $N_{incident}$ is number of incident ions, $E_i$ is ion energy, $\theta$ is incidence angle, $Z_i$ is ion atomic number, and $Z_t$ is target atomic number.

  Physical significance: Divertor sputtering yield determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through impurity control and directly affects [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [impurity_transport](#impurity_transport) and material erosion in divertor scenarios. Strongly coupled to [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics), [edge-physics](#edge-physics), and [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) through erosion mechanisms. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and material protection.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Surface analysis techniques measure erosion rates for yield determination. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) modeling calculates yields based on plasma parameters. [Plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) analysis uses yield data for impurity predictions. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) monitors impurity concentrations. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Sputtering yield 0.01-0.1 atoms/ion for carbon targets at 100-500 eV ion energy. JET: 0.005-0.08 for various materials. DIII-D: 0.003-0.05 depending on plasma conditions. Yield increases with ion energy and decreases with material atomic number. Range across machines: 0.003-0.1 atoms/ion.

  Sign convention: Positive when sputtering yield indicates material erosion rate from divertor targets under plasma bombardment.
