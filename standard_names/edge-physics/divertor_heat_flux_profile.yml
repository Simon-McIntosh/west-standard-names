description: Spatial profile of heat flux to divertor target plates in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Divertor heat flux profile representing the spatial distribution of heat load on divertor target plates in magnetized plasmas. This profile determines the thermal loading on plasma-facing components and affects divertor performance and material lifetime in tokamak operation. The heat flux profile is characterized by peak loads, width, and distribution patterns that depend on magnetic configuration and plasma conditions.

  Governing equation:
  $$q_{div}(s) = q_0 \exp\left(-\frac{s^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

  where $q_{div}(s)$ is heat flux at position s, $q_0$ is peak heat flux, and $\sigma$ is profile width.

  Physical significance: Divertor heat flux profile determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through heat exhaust and directly affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) optimization in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) and material protection in divertor scenarios. Strongly coupled to [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics), [edge-physics](#edge-physics), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through magnetic footprint effects. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and divertor protection.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Infrared cameras measure surface temperatures for heat flux profile determination. [Imaging](#imaging) analysis converts temperatures to heat fluxes using material properties. [Divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) modeling calculates profiles based on magnetic geometry. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines magnetic footprint. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: Peak heat flux 10-20 MW/m² with profile width 1-5 cm on divertor targets. JET: 5-15 MW/m² with width 0.5-3 cm. DIII-D: 3-10 MW/m² with width 0.2-2 cm. Peak loads typically 2-5 times average values. Range across machines: 3-20 MW/m² peak flux.

  Sign convention: Positive when heat flux values indicate power flow from plasma to divertor target plates along magnetic field lines.
