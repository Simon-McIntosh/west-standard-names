description: Power absorbed by plasma electrons from electron cyclotron heating systems.
documentation: |-
  Electron cyclotron absorbed power representing the power absorbed by plasma electrons from electron cyclotron heating (ECH) systems in magnetized plasmas. This heating mechanism operates at frequencies matching electron cyclotron resonances and provides highly localized electron heating through resonant wave-particle interactions. ECH is essential for achieving high electron temperatures and precise heating control in tokamak operation, with absorption efficiency depending strongly on electron temperature, density, and magnetic field strength.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{absorbed} = P_{EC} \cdot \eta_{absorption} \cdot \eta_{coupling}$$

  where $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $P_{EC}$ is injected EC power, $\eta_{absorption}$ is absorption efficiency, and $\eta_{coupling}$ is coupling efficiency.

  Physical significance: Electron cyclotron absorbed power determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through electron heating and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for achieving high electron temperatures and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [electron_density](#electron_density), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through resonance conditions. Essential for [electron_cyclotron_current_drive](#electron_cyclotron_current_drive) and localized heating control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: ECH system monitors measure injected and reflected power for absorption analysis. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profiles for heating efficiency validation. ECH modeling codes calculate absorption based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance locations. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: ECH absorbed power 20-30 MW at 170 GHz with absorption efficiency 80-95%. JET: 15-25 MW at 140 GHz with efficiency 70-90%. DIII-D: 8-15 MW at 110 GHz with efficiency 65-85%. Higher absorption at elevated [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) > 5 keV and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 8-30 MW depending on system capability.

  Sign convention: Positive absorbed power indicates energy transfer from EC waves to plasma electrons through resonant absorption processes.
