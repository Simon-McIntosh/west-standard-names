  electrons.
documentation: |-
  Electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) representing current drive mechanism using electron cyclotron waves to accelerate electrons and generate non-inductive current. Wave absorption at electron cyclotron resonance provides momentum and energy to electrons along magnetic field lines. Essential for localized [current_drive](#current_drive) and [current_profile](#current_profile) control with high spatial precision. Critical for [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) control through localized current drive. ECCD efficiency depends strongly on [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [electron_density](#electron_density), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Key technology for ITER and advanced tokamak scenarios requiring precise current profile control.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{ECCD} = \frac{e n_e v_{te}^3}{\omega_{ce}} \frac{P_{absorbed}}{T_e} \eta_{EC}$$

  where $j_{ECCD}$ is ECCD current density, $e$ is elementary charge, $n_e$ is electron density, $v_{te}$ is electron thermal velocity, $\omega_{ce}$ is electron cyclotron frequency, $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $T_e$ is electron temperature, and $\eta_{EC}$ is ECCD efficiency.

  Physical significance: ECCD provides precise localized current drive for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) control and [current_profile](#current_profile) optimization. Critical for suppressing [tearing_mode](#tearing_mode) instabilities and controlling [kink_instability](#kink_instability) through localized current drive. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) with reduced auxiliary power requirements.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles for ECCD efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance locations and wave propagation paths. ECCD codes calculate current drive efficiency and deposition profiles based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) measures electron cyclotron wave absorption. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) control and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: ECCD efficiency $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.1-0.3$ A/W at 170 GHz, localized deposition width ~2-5 cm. JET: $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.08-0.25$ A/W at 140 GHz. DIII-D: $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.08-0.25$ A/W at 110 GHz. Higher efficiency at elevated [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.08-0.3 A/W (mean ~0.15 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive ECCD drives current in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), with sign depending on wave frequency and magnetic field orientation.
