description: Efficiency of lower hybrid current drive in accelerating electrons to
  high velocities.
documentation: |-
  Lower hybrid current drive efficiency representing the effectiveness of lower hybrid waves in accelerating electrons to high velocities along magnetic field lines for non-inductive current drive. This efficiency parameter quantifies the current generated per unit of absorbed power and is crucial for tokamak current drive optimization. The efficiency depends strongly on electron temperature, density, and magnetic field strength, with optimal conditions achieved at high electron temperatures and appropriate wave accessibility.

  Governing equation:
  $$\eta_{LHCD} = \frac{j_{LHCD} R}{P_{absorbed}} = \frac{e n_e v_{te}^2}{\omega_{LH} T_e} \eta_{wave}$$

  where $\eta_{LHCD}$ is LHCD efficiency, $j_{LHCD}$ is current density, $R$ is major radius, $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $e$ is elementary charge, $n_e$ is electron density, $v_{te}$ is electron thermal velocity, $\omega_{LH}$ is lower hybrid frequency, $T_e$ is electron temperature, and $\eta_{wave}$ is wave coupling efficiency.

  Physical significance: Lower hybrid current drive efficiency determines [current_drive](#current_drive) effectiveness and directly affects [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) capabilities in tokamak plasmas. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through efficient non-inductive current drive. Strongly coupled to [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [electron_density](#electron_density), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through wave accessibility and absorption physics. Essential for advanced tokamak scenarios requiring high bootstrap fractions.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles for efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines wave accessibility and resonance locations. LHCD modeling codes calculate efficiency based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Current_profile](#current_profile) measurements validate current drive effectiveness. Critical for [current_drive](#current_drive) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $\eta_{LHCD} \approx 0.2-0.4$ A/W at 5 GHz, optimized for high electron temperatures. JET: $\eta_{LHCD} \approx 0.15-0.35$ A/W at 3.7 GHz. DIII-D: $\eta_{LHCD} \approx 0.12-0.30$ A/W at 4.6 GHz. Higher efficiency at elevated [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) > 5 keV and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.12-0.4 A/W (mean ~0.25 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive efficiency indicates current drive in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following tokamak current drive conventions.
