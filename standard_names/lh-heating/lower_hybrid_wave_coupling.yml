name: lower_hybrid_wave_coupling
description: Coupling efficiency of lower hybrid waves to plasma electrons.
documentation: |-
  Lower hybrid wave coupling representing the efficiency of power transfer from lower hybrid antennas to plasma electrons in magnetized plasmas. This coupling process determines the accessibility and effectiveness of lower hybrid current drive and heating systems. Wave coupling depends on antenna geometry, plasma parameters near the antenna, and magnetic field orientation relative to the wave propagation direction. Optimal coupling is essential for efficient lower hybrid system operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\eta_{coupling} = \frac{P_{absorbed}}{P_{forward}} = 1 - \left|\Gamma\right|^2$$

  where $\eta_{coupling}$ is coupling efficiency, $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $P_{forward}$ is forward power, and $\Gamma$ is reflection coefficient.

  Physical significance: Lower hybrid wave coupling determines [lower_hybrid_current_drive](#lower_hybrid_current_drive) effectiveness and directly affects [current_drive](#current_drive) system performance in tokamak operation. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization through efficient power transfer to plasma electrons. Strongly coupled to [electron_density](#electron_density) near the antenna, [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) geometry, and antenna-plasma gap distance. Essential for [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) with reduced auxiliary power requirements.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Antenna impedance measurements determine reflection coefficients and coupling efficiency. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles near antenna for coupling analysis. Lower hybrid wave modeling codes calculate coupling based on antenna geometry and plasma parameters. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines wave accessibility. Critical for [current_drive](#current_drive) system design.

  Typical values: ITER: Coupling efficiency 70-90% with optimized antenna-plasma gap (2-5 cm). JET: 60-85% depending on plasma conditions. DIII-D: 65-88% with active coupling control. Higher coupling at elevated [electron_density](#electron_density) > 1×10¹⁹ m⁻³ near antenna and optimized magnetic geometry. Range across machines: 60-90% (mean ~75%).

  Sign convention: Positive coupling efficiency indicates power transfer from antenna to plasma, with 100% representing perfect coupling and 0% representing total reflection.
