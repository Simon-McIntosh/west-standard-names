  to high velocities.
documentation: |-
  Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) representing current drive mechanism using lower hybrid waves to accelerate electrons to high velocities along magnetic field lines. Efficient current drive mechanism particularly effective at high [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) conditions. Essential for [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) and [current_profile](#current_profile) control in tokamak plasmas. Critical for achieving high [bootstrap_fraction](#bootstrap_fraction) and advanced [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. LHCD efficiency depends strongly on [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [electron_density](#electron_density). Key technology for tokamak current drive systems requiring high-efficiency non-inductive current drive.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{LHCD} = \frac{e n_e v_{te}^2}{\omega_{LH}} \frac{P_{absorbed}}{T_e} \eta_{LH}$$

  where $j_{LHCD}$ is LHCD current density, $e$ is elementary charge, $n_e$ is electron density, $v_{te}$ is electron thermal velocity, $\omega_{LH}$ is lower hybrid frequency, $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $T_e$ is electron temperature, and $\eta_{LH}$ is LHCD efficiency.

  Physical significance: LHCD provides efficient bulk current drive for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation). Critical for maintaining [plasma_current](#plasma_current) with reduced auxiliary power requirements. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta). Essential for advanced tokamak scenarios requiring high bootstrap fractions and efficient current drive. Related to [current_drive](#current_drive) optimization and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) enhancement.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles for LHCD efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines wave propagation and accessibility. LHCD codes calculate current drive efficiency and deposition profiles based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) measures lower hybrid wave absorption and current drive effectiveness. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) control and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: LHCD efficiency $\eta_{LH} \approx 0.2-0.4$ A/W at 5 GHz, effective for bulk current drive. JET: $\eta_{LH} \approx 0.15-0.35$ A/W at 3.7 GHz. DIII-D: $\eta_{LH} \approx 0.12-0.30$ A/W at 4.6 GHz. Higher efficiency at elevated [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.12-0.4 A/W (mean ~0.25 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive LHCD drives current in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following tokamak current drive conventions.
