description: High confinement mode in tokamak plasmas with improved transport barriers.
documentation: |-
  High confinement mode (H-mode) characterized by improved plasma confinement with transport barriers at the plasma edge. Self-generated improved confinement regime discovered in tokamaks with sufficient heating power. Critical for achieving high performance tokamak operation. H-mode features reduced turbulent transport and improved energy confinement. Essential for ITER and future tokamak scenarios.

  Governing equation:
  $$\tau_{E,H} \approx 2 \tau_{E,L}$$

  where $\tau_{E,H}$ is H-mode confinement time and $\tau_{E,L}$ is L-mode confinement time.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) significantly. H-mode enables better [fusion_reactivity](#fusion_reactivity) and reduced heating requirements. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Related to [edge_localized_modes](#edge_localized_modes), [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport), and [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure). Essential for high-performance operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures edge profiles and transport barriers. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#Magnetic_diagnostics) provide edge stability constraints. [Interferometry](#interferometry) measures density profiles. Power balance analysis determines confinement improvement. Critical for H-mode threshold prediction and scenario optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: H-mode threshold power $P_{th} \approx 50-80$ MW, confinement improvement factor $H_{98} \approx 1.0-1.2$. JET: $P_{th} \approx 8-15$ MW, $H_{98} \approx 0.8-1.1$. DIII-D: $P_{th} \approx 2-5$ MW, $H_{98} \approx 0.9-1.3$. Higher heating power required for H-mode access.
