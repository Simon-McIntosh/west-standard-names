description: Self-generated plasma current from pressure gradients and trapped particles.
documentation: |-
  Bootstrap current representing self-generated plasma current arising from pressure gradients and trapped particle effects in toroidal magnetic geometry. This neoclassical current drive mechanism generates current without external power input, making it essential for steady-state tokamak operation and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. The current fraction can reach 50-80% in advanced scenarios, significantly reducing auxiliary power requirements for sustained operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{bs} = -\frac{c}{e} \frac{p_e}{T_e} \left[ L_{31} \frac{d\ln p_e}{d\psi} + L_{32} \frac{d\ln T_e}{d\psi} \right] \langle B^2 \rangle$$

  where $p_e$ is electron pressure, $T_e$ is electron temperature, $L_{31}$ and $L_{32}$ are neoclassical coefficients depending on [collisionality](#collisionality), and $\langle B^2 \rangle$ is flux surface averaged magnetic field strength.

  Physical significance: Bootstrap current determines [bootstrap_fraction](#bootstrap_fraction) and directly affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) efficiency and sustainability. Higher bootstrap current reduces [current_drive](#current_drive) requirements and enables [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation). Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization through reduced auxiliary power needs. Strongly coupled to [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design in advanced operating modes.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines pressure gradients and magnetic geometry factors for bootstrap calculations. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profiles essential for pressure gradient calculations. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) data for total pressure profiles. Sauter bootstrap current formula and neoclassical codes calculate current density based on [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) and kinetic profiles. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) analysis and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: $j_{bs} \approx 0.5-2.0$ MA/m$^2$ in H-mode scenarios, bootstrap fraction 50-80%. JET: $j_{bs} \approx 0.2-1.5$ MA/m$^2$, fraction 40-70%. DIII-D: $j_{bs} \approx 0.3-1.8$ MA/m$^2$, fraction 45-75%. Higher fractions achieved in advanced scenarios with strong pressure gradients and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.2-2.0 MA/m$^2$ (mean ~1.0 MA/m$^2$).

  Sign convention: Positive bootstrap current flows in direction of plasma current (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following standard tokamak current conventions.
