description: Time coordinate for time-dependent measurements.
documentation: 'Time coordinate $t$ for time-dependent measurements and evolution
  of plasma quantities. Typically measured relative to a discharge reference time
  (e.g., $t=0$ at plasma initiation or start of main heating phase).


  Time resolution and sampling rates vary by diagnostic and measurement type. High-speed
  magnetics: 0.1-1 MHz, equilibrium reconstruction: 1-10 kHz, slow diagnostics: 10-100
  Hz.


  Accurate time synchronization across all diagnostics is essential for integrated
  data analysis and cross-validation of measurements.'
