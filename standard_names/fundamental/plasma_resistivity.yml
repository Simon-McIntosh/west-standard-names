documentation: |-
  Plasma resistivity $\eta$ determining current diffusion and Ohmic heating. Spitzer resistivity: $\eta = \frac{Z_{eff} e^2 \ln \Lambda}{4\pi \epsilon_0^2 m_e^{1/2} T_e^{3/2}}$. Depends on electron temperature and effective charge $Z_{eff}$. Controls current diffusion time and skin depth. Essential for current ramp scenarios and transformer operation. Lower resistivity at higher temperatures enables more efficient current drive and faster current diffusion.

  Governing equation:
  $$\eta = \frac{Z_{eff} e^2 \ln \Lambda}{4\pi \epsilon_0^2 m_e^{1/2} T_e^{3/2}} \approx 5.2 \times 10^{-5} \frac{Z_{eff} \ln \Lambda}{T_e^{3/2}}$$

  where $Z_{eff}$ is effective charge, $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C is electron charge, $\ln \Lambda$ is Coulomb logarithm, $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m is permittivity of free space, $m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg is electron mass, and $T_e$ is electron temperature in eV.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [current_evolution](#current_evolution) and affects [Ohmic_heating](#Ohmic_heating) efficiency. Lower resistivity enables faster [current_drive](#current_drive) and better [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation). Critical for [current_ramp](#current_ramp) scenarios and [skin_current](#skin_current) analysis. Related to [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [collisionality](#collisionality), and [electric_field](#electric_field). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and current profile control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profiles. [Spectroscopy](#spectroscopy) determines $Z_{eff}$ from impurity line ratios. [Current_evolution](#current_evolution) analysis infers resistivity from current diffusion. [Electric_field](#electric_field) measurements provide direct constraints. Resistivity calculations use Spitzer formula with kinetic profile inputs. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) modeling and scenario optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $\eta \approx 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ $\Omega\cdot$m in H-mode scenarios. JET: $5 \times 10^{-8}-5 \times 10^{-7}$ $\Omega\cdot$m. DIII-D: $8 \times 10^{-8}-8 \times 10^{-7}$ $\Omega\cdot$m. Lower resistivity at higher temperatures enables more efficient current drive.

  Sign convention: Positive resistivity indicates energy dissipation, following standard electrical conventions.
