description: Temporal evolution of plasma current during tokamak operation.
documentation: 'Current evolution $I_p(t)$ describing the temporal development of
  plasma current during tokamak pulses. Includes current ramp-up, flat-top, and ramp-down
  phases. Governed by transformer action and current diffusion: $\frac{\partial I_p}{\partial
  t} = \frac{V_{loop} - R_p I_p}{L_p}$. Critical for scenario planning and control
  system design. Current diffusion time determines ramp rates and skin current formation.
  Affects MHD stability and performance throughout the pulse.'
