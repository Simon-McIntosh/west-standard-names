documentation: |-
  Safety factor $q$ measuring the ratio of toroidal to poloidal field line rotations. Fundamental stability parameter controlling MHD instabilities and determining operational boundaries. Critical for tokamak stability analysis and scenario design.

  Governing equation:
  $$q = \frac{d\Phi_{tor}}{d\psi} = \frac{\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l}_{tor}}{\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l}_{pol}}$$

  where $\Phi_{tor}$ is toroidal flux, $\psi$ is poloidal flux, and the integrals are taken along field lines.

  Physical significance: Safety factor determines [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through stability boundaries for [kink_instability](#kink_instability) and [tearing_mode](#tearing_mode). Stable operation typically requires $q > 1$ at edge and $q > 2$ at magnetic axis. Current profile shape directly affects $q$-profile and determines [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) efficiency. Related to [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and [magnetic_shear](#magnetic_shear). Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [current_profile_control](#current_profile_control).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines $q$-profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Motional_Stark_effect](#Motional_Stark_effect) provides direct $q$ measurements. [Current_profile](#current_profile) analysis relates $q$ to current density. $q$-profile control essential for [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) and performance optimization.

  Typical values: Tokamak operation typically requires $q > 1$ everywhere. ITER: $q_{95} = 3.0-3.5$. JET: $q_{95} = 2.5-4.0$. DIII-D: $q_{95} = 2.8-3.8$. Central $q_0$ typically 1.0-1.5, edge $q_a$ typically 2.5-4.0.

  Sign convention: Positive $q$ follows standard tokamak convention with counter-clockwise toroidal field and current.
