name: plasma_beta
description: Ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure measuring confinement efficiency.
documentation: |-
  Plasma beta $\beta$ measuring ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure: $\beta = \frac{p}{B^2/2\mu_0}$. Fundamental parameter measuring confinement efficiency and MHD stability limits. Critical for tokamak performance and operational limits. Higher beta improves fusion performance but reduces stability margins. Essential for tokamak design and scenario optimization. Beta limits determined by Troyon scaling and MHD stability analysis.

  Governing equation:
  $$\beta = \frac{p}{B^2/2\mu_0} = \frac{2\mu_0 p}{B^2}$$

  where $p$ is plasma pressure in Pa, $B$ is magnetic field strength in T, and $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m is permeability of free space.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) limits and affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) boundaries. Higher $\beta$ enables better [fusion_reactivity](#fusion_reactivity) but increases risk of [ballooning_mode](#ballooning_mode) and [kink_instability](#kink_instability). Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) assessment and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) scaling. Related to [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) and [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure) through force balance. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational limit determination.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_pressure](#electron_pressure) from $n_e T_e$ product. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) for total pressure calculation. [Diamagnetic_loop](#Diamagnetic_loop) measures diamagnetic flux related to total beta. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines pressure and magnetic field profiles. Beta analysis critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) assessment and performance optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $\beta_N = 2.8-3.5$ (normalized beta), $\beta_p = 1.5-2.5$ (poloidal beta). JET: $\beta_N = 2.0-3.2$, $\beta_p = 1.0-2.2$. DIII-D: $\beta_N = 2.5-3.8$, $\beta_p = 1.2-2.8$. Higher beta enables better fusion performance but requires careful stability control.

  Sign convention: Positive beta indicates plasma pressure exceeding magnetic pressure, following standard plasma physics conventions.
