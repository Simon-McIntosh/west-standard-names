description: Toroidal component of magnetic field in tokamak configuration.
documentation: |-
  Toroidal magnetic field $B_{tor}$ generated by toroidal field coils. In vacuum, follows $B_{tor}(R) = B_0 R_0 / R$ where $B_0$ is the field at reference major radius $R_0$. Primary confinement field in tokamaks, providing poloidal confinement when combined with poloidal field from plasma current. Field strength determines cyclotron frequency, particle confinement, and MHD stability limits. Typical values: ITER $B_0 = 5.3$ T, JET $B_0 = 3.4-3.8$ T, DIII-D $B_0 = 2.2$ T.

  Governing equation:
  $$B_{tor}(R) = B_0 \frac{R_0}{R}$$

  where $B_0$ is the toroidal field at reference major radius $R_0$, and $R$ is the major radius coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q \propto B_{tor}/B_{pol}$ and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries. Higher $B_{tor}$ enables higher [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and better confinement but increases engineering complexity. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction. Related to [vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field_at_reference_major_radius](#vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field_at_reference_major_radius) and [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational limit determination.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Magnetic probes measure toroidal field strength directly. [Toroidal_field_coil](#Toroidal_field_coil) current measurements determine $B_{tor}$ through calibration. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses $B_{tor}$ profiles for force balance calculations. Field mapping systems provide detailed spatial profiles. Critical for [safety_factor](#safety_factor) calculations and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $B_0 = 5.3$ T at $R_0 = 6.2$ m, $B_{tor}(R_{axis}) \approx 5.7$ T. JET: $B_0 = 3.4-3.8$ T at $R_0 = 3.0$ m. DIII-D: $B_0 = 2.2$ T at $R_0 = 1.7$ m. Higher fields enable better confinement but require more powerful coils.

  Sign convention: Positive when anti-clockwise viewing from above (positive toroidal angle direction).
