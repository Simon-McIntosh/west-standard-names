description: Pressure-driven MHD instability in toroidal magnetic fields.
documentation: |-
  Ballooning mode instability representing pressure-driven magnetohydrodynamic instability in toroidal magnetic fields where plasma pressure gradients interact with unfavorable magnetic curvature. Localized mode that peaks at outboard midplane where magnetic field lines are subject to adverse curvature, driving the plasma outward. Critical for determining [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and operational boundaries in tokamak operation. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis. Ballooning modes represent fundamental beta limits in toroidal devices, directly impacting [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and operational safety.

  Governing equation:
  $$\gamma^2 \propto -\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} \frac{\kappa}{q^2}$$

  where $\gamma$ is growth rate, $\partial p/\partial r$ is pressure gradient, $\kappa$ is magnetic curvature (negative for unfavorable curvature), and $q$ is [safety_factor](#safety_factor).

  Physical significance: Ballooning modes determine [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and directly affect [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries in tokamak operation. These modes set fundamental beta limits that restrict maximum plasma performance. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) safety and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. Strongly coupled to [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Essential for operational limit determination and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Related to [magnetic_shear](#magnetic_shear) through stability effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures pressure gradients essential for ballooning stability analysis. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction supplies geometric factors and curvature calculations. [Mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) codes calculate ballooning growth rates based on pressure gradients and magnetic geometry. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide stability constraints and equilibrium validation. Critical for beta limit determination and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Stability analysis determines maximum allowable pressure gradients.

  Typical values: ITER: Critical $\beta_N \approx 2.8-3.2$ for ballooning modes in optimized scenarios. JET: $\beta_N \approx 2.0-2.8$ in high-performance H-mode operation. DIII-D: $\beta_N \approx 2.5-3.0$ with advanced magnetic configurations. Lower limits at higher pressure gradients and lower [safety_factor](#safety_factor) values. Range across machines: $\beta_N$ 2.0-3.2 (mean ~2.7), with higher values achievable through optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) and [magnetic_shear](#magnetic_shear).

  Sign convention: Positive growth rates indicate unstable modes, following standard MHD stability conventions where $\gamma > 0$ represents exponentially growing perturbations.
