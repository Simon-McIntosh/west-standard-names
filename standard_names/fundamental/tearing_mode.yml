description: Magnetic reconnection instability in tokamak plasma configurations.
documentation: |-
  Tearing mode instability involving magnetic reconnection in tokamak plasma configurations where resistive effects allow magnetic field lines to break and reconnect, forming magnetic islands. Resistive mode affecting plasma stability when current gradients are steep and [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) is finite. Critical for understanding disruptions and maintaining plasma stability. Mode structure involves magnetic island formation and growth that can lead to [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) termination. Essential for tokamak operational safety and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Governing equation:
  $$\gamma \propto \Delta' \eta$$

  where $\gamma$ is growth rate, $\Delta'$ is stability parameter depending on current gradients, and $\eta$ is [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity).

  Physical significance: Tearing modes determine [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries and directly affect [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) safety in tokamak plasmas. These modes can lead to disruptions and significantly impact [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance). Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) control and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Strongly coupled to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor). Essential for disruption avoidance and operational reliability.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current gradients and stability parameters for tearing analysis. [Mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) codes calculate tearing growth rates based on current profiles and resistivity. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide magnetic field measurements and island detection. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures resistivity profiles for stability calculations. Critical for disruption prediction and stability analysis in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: Critical $\Delta' \approx 1-3$ for unstable tearing modes in high-current scenarios. JET: $\Delta' \approx 0.8-2.5$ during high-performance operation. DIII-D: $\Delta' \approx 1.2-2.8$ with advanced profile control. Lower [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) reduces tearing mode growth rates significantly. Range across machines: $\Delta'$ 0.8-3.0 (mean ~1.8).

  Sign convention: Positive growth rates indicate unstable modes, following standard MHD stability conventions where $\gamma > 0$ represents exponentially growing magnetic islands.
