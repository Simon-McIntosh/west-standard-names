description: Toroidal component of plasma current density.
documentation: 'Toroidal current density $j_{tor}$ representing the component of plasma
  current flowing in the toroidal direction. Primary component of plasma current in
  tokamaks, generated by transformer action or external drive. Related to parallel
  current density via magnetic field pitch angle. Determines poloidal magnetic field
  through Ampère''s law: $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j}$. Integration
  over poloidal cross-section gives total plasma current. Essential for MHD equilibrium
  and stability analysis.'
