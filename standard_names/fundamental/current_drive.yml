description: External mechanisms for driving plasma current in tokamaks.
documentation: |-
  Current drive representing external mechanisms for maintaining and controlling plasma current in tokamaks without relying solely on transformer action. Includes [lower_hybrid_current_drive](#lower_hybrid_current_drive) (LHCD), [electron_cyclotron_current_drive](#electron_cyclotron_current_drive) (ECCD), and [neutral_beam_current_drive](#neutral_beam_current_drive) (NBCD). Essential for [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) and [current_profile](#current_profile) control. Higher drive efficiency reduces auxiliary power requirements and improves tokamak sustainability and operational flexibility.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{drive} = \frac{P_{absorbed}}{\eta_{drive}} \frac{1}{E_{char}}$$

  where $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $\eta_{drive}$ is current drive efficiency depending on [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) and [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity), and $E_{char}$ is characteristic energy of drive mechanism.

  Physical significance: Current drive determines [plasma_current](#plasma_current) maintenance and directly affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) efficiency and sustainability. Reduces reliance on [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) and enables [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation). Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta). Essential for advanced tokamak operating modes and scenario flexibility.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Power absorption analysis determines current drive efficiency from wave deposition and momentum transfer. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profiles essential for drive efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction supplies geometric constraints for current drive deposition. Current drive codes calculate deposition profiles, efficiency, and current density based on wave physics and plasma parameters. Critical for [current_profile](#current_profile) control and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: LHCD efficiency $\eta_{LH} \approx 0.2-0.4$ A/W, ECCD $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.1-0.3$ A/W, NBCD $\eta_{NB} \approx 0.05-0.2$ A/W. JET: LHCD $\eta_{LH} \approx 0.15-0.35$ A/W, ECCD $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.08-0.25$ A/W. DIII-D: ECCD $\eta_{EC} \approx 0.08-0.25$ A/W, NBCD $\eta_{NB} \approx 0.04-0.18$ A/W. Higher efficiency reduces auxiliary power requirements for sustained operation. Range across machines: 0.04-0.4 A/W (mean ~0.15 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive current drive enhances plasma current in standard direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following tokamak current conventions.
