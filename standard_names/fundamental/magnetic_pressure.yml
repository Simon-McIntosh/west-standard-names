description: Pressure exerted by magnetic field on plasma.
documentation: |-
  Magnetic pressure $p_{mag} = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}$ exerted by magnetic field on plasma. Balances plasma pressure in MHD equilibrium: $\nabla (p + p_{mag}) = \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{B}$. Essential for pressure balance calculations and MHD stability analysis. Determines confinement capability and operational limits. Related to plasma beta: $\beta = \frac{p}{p_{mag}}$.

  Governing equation:
  $$p_{mag} = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}$$

  where $B$ is the magnetic field magnitude and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

  Physical significance: This quantity represents the confining pressure of magnetic fields in plasma. Balances [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure) in [mhd_equilibrium](#mhd_equilibrium) through force balance. Determines [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and confinement capability. Critical for tokamak operation and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis. Higher magnetic pressure enables higher plasma pressure and better confinement.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from magnetic equilibrium reconstruction using magnetic field profiles. [Flux_surface_averaged_squared_magnetic_field_strength](#flux_surface_averaged_squared_magnetic_field_strength) provides surface-averaged values. [Diamagnetic_loop](#Diamagnetic_loop) measurements constrain magnetic pressure profiles. Essential for pressure balance analysis and beta limits calculations.

  Typical values: ITER: $p_{mag} \approx 10-100$ MPa depending on $B_{tor}$ profile. JET: $5-50$ MPa. DIII-D: $2-25$ MPa. Values scale with $B^2$ and are highest near magnetic axis where toroidal field is strongest.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing confining pressure.
