description: Surface current layer formed during rapid current changes in plasma.
documentation: |-
  Skin current $j_{skin}$ representing current density concentrated near plasma surface during rapid current changes in tokamak operation. Forms when current diffusion time exceeds ramp time, creating current profile with peaked edge structure. This phenomenon occurs during plasma startup, current ramp phases, and rapid transient events where the resistive diffusion of current cannot keep pace with the applied electric field. Skin current affects MHD stability, particularly external kink modes and tearing modes, and determines current penetration depth through the skin effect.

  Governing equation:
  $$\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2\eta}{\mu_0 \omega}} = \sqrt{\frac{2\eta}{\mu_0} \tau_{diffusion}}$$


  where $\delta$ is skin depth, $\eta$ is plasma resistivity, $\mu_0$ is permeability of free space, $\omega$ is frequency, and $\tau_{diffusion}$ is current diffusion time.

  Physical significance: Skin current determines [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through edge current concentration and directly affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) during transient phases. Critical for understanding [current_ramp](#current_ramp) scenarios and disruption avoidance. Strongly coupled to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through current diffusion effects. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational safety.


  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures resistivity profiles for skin depth calculations. [Current_evolution](#current_evolution) analysis tracks skin current formation and decay. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide edge current measurements. Critical for transient analysis and scenario optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Skin depth $\delta$ = 2-8 cm during current ramp, skin current density 2-5 MA/m² at edge. JET: $\delta$ = 1-5 cm, edge density 1-3 MA/m². DIII-D: $\delta$ = 0.5-3 cm, edge density 0.8-2.5 MA/m². Skin depth decreases with higher temperature and lower resistivity.


  Sign convention: Positive when skin current flows in direction of plasma current (counter-clockwise viewing from above), with edge concentration indicating skin effect during rapid changes.
