description: Magnetohydrodynamic stability analysis of plasma configurations.
documentation: |-
  Magnetohydrodynamic stability representing comprehensive analysis of plasma configurations susceptibility to various magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. Includes ideal MHD modes ([kink_instability](#kink_instability), [ballooning_mode](#ballooning_mode)) and resistive modes ([tearing_mode](#tearing_mode), reconnecting modes). Stability boundaries determined by pressure gradients, current profiles, and magnetic geometry. Critical for tokamak operational limits and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. Higher stability margins enable higher performance operation with improved [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) flexibility.

  Governing equation:
  $$\gamma^2 = -\frac{\delta W}{\delta K}$$

  where $\gamma$ is growth rate, $\delta W$ is potential energy change, and $\delta K$ is kinetic energy change for perturbed plasma configurations.

  Physical significance: MHD stability determines [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) boundaries and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) limits in tokamak plasmas. Stable operation requires $\gamma < 0$ for all unstable modes. Critical for [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Strongly coupled to [safety_factor](#safety_factor), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure). Essential for operational safety and performance optimization in all tokamak operating regimes.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction provides equilibrium profiles for comprehensive stability analysis. [Mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) codes calculate growth rates for various MHD modes based on equilibrium and profiles. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures pressure gradients essential for stability calculations. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide constraints and validation for stability analysis. Critical for operational limit determination and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization across all operating regimes.

  Typical values: ITER: Maximum stable $\beta_N \approx 2.8-3.5$ for ideal MHD modes in optimized scenarios. JET: $\beta_N \approx 2.0-3.2$ in high-performance H-mode operation. DIII-D: $\beta_N \approx 2.5-3.8$ with advanced magnetic configurations. Higher stability margins enable better [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) but require careful profile control. Range across machines: $\beta_N$ 2.0-3.8 (mean ~3.0).
