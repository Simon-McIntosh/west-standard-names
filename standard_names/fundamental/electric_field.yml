description: Electric field in plasma driving current and affecting particle motion.
documentation: |-
  Electric field $\mathbf{E}$ in plasma driving current and affecting particle dynamics. In tokamaks, toroidal electric field drives Ohmic current during current ramp. Perpendicular electric fields affect particle drifts and rotation. Field strength determines current drive efficiency and particle acceleration. Essential for understanding current diffusion, particle orbits, and plasma rotation. Measured by electric probes or inferred from current evolution.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} - \nabla \phi$$

  where $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential and $\phi$ is the scalar potential.

  Physical significance: This quantity drives [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through Ohm's law and affects particle motion via the Lorentz force. Critical for [current_drive](#current_drive) efficiency and [current_ramp](#current_ramp) scenarios. Related to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) through Ohm's law: $\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}$. Essential for understanding [current_evolution](#current_evolution) and [skin_current](#skin_current) effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Electric probes measure local electric fields directly. [Current_evolution](#current_evolution) analysis infers electric fields from current diffusion. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines electric field profiles. Loop voltage measurements provide global electric field constraints. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and scenario modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $E_{tor} \approx 0.1-0.5$ V/m during current ramp. JET: $0.05-0.3$ V/m. DIII-D: $0.08-0.4$ V/m. Perpendicular fields typically much smaller: $E_{\perp} \sim 0.01-0.1$ V/m.

  Sign convention: Positive toroidal electric field drives current in the same direction as plasma current (counter-clockwise viewing from above).
