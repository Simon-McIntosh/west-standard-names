description: Current-driven MHD instability in tokamak plasma configurations.
documentation: |-
  Kink instability representing current-driven magnetohydrodynamic instability in tokamak plasma configurations where plasma current gradients and pressure gradients interact to drive global displacement of the plasma column. Current-driven mode affecting plasma stability at high current and low [safety_factor](#safety_factor) conditions. Critical for determining operational limits and [current_profile](#current_profile) requirements. Mode structure involves global displacement that can lead to plasma-wall contact if unstable. Essential for tokamak safety and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Governing equation:
  $$\gamma^2 \propto \frac{\partial j}{\partial r} \frac{1}{q^2}$$

  where $\gamma$ is growth rate, $\partial j/\partial r$ is current gradient, and $q$ is [safety_factor](#safety_factor).

  Physical significance: Kink instabilities determine [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) boundaries and directly affect [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) limits in tokamak plasmas. These modes set current limits and affect [safety_factor](#safety_factor) requirements for stable operation. Critical for [plasma_current](#plasma_current) profile control and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), and [current_profile](#current_profile). Essential for operational safety and performance optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current profiles and gradients for kink stability analysis. [Mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) codes calculate kink growth rates based on current profiles and magnetic geometry. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide current density constraints and stability validation. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures pressure profiles for coupled stability analysis. Critical for current limit determination and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Maximum stable $q_{min} \approx 1.5-2.0$ for kink modes in optimized scenarios. JET: $q_{min} \approx 1.2-1.8$ in high-performance operation. DIII-D: $q_{min} \approx 1.3-1.9$ with advanced profile control. Higher minimum [safety_factor](#safety_factor) values required for stable operation at high [plasma_current](#plasma_current). Range across machines: $q_{min}$ 1.2-2.0 (mean ~1.6).

  Sign convention: Positive growth rates indicate unstable modes, following standard MHD stability conventions where $\gamma > 0$ represents exponentially growing perturbations.
