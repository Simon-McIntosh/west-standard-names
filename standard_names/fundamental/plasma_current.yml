description: Total toroidal plasma current.
documentation: "Total toroidal current $I_p$ flowing in the plasma, defined as the\
  \ surface integral of toroidal current density:\n\n$$I_p = \\int \\mathbf{J}_{\\\
  phi} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$$\n\nintegrated over a poloidal cross-section.\n\n**Sign\
  \ convention:** Positive current is anti-clockwise when viewed from above (in the\
  \ direction of increasing toroidal angle $\\phi$).\n\nThe plasma current is a fundamental\
  \ parameter controlling plasma confinement, MHD stability, and current-driven effects.\
  \ It is related to poloidal flux and magnetic field via Amp\xE8re's law. Measurements\
  \ typically use Rogowski coils or are inferred from magnetic equilibrium reconstruction.\n\
  \nTypical values: 0.1-15 MA in tokamaks depending on device size. Evolution of $I_p$\
  \ determines resistive skin time, current diffusion, and operational scenarios."
