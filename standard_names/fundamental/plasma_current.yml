description: Total toroidal plasma current.
documentation: |-
  Total toroidal plasma current $I_p$ flowing in the plasma, defined as the surface integral of toroidal current density over the plasma's poloidal cross section. Fundamental parameter controlling plasma confinement, MHD stability, and current-driven effects. Related to poloidal flux and magnetic field via Ampère's law.

  Governing equation:
  $$I_p = \int_{\text{plasma cross-section}} \mathbf{J}_{\phi} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where $\mathbf{J}_{\phi}$ is toroidal current density in A/m$^2$ and $d\mathbf{A}$ is differential area element in m$^2$. The integration is performed over the plasma's poloidal cross section (constant toroidal angle $\phi$), typically taken at $\phi = 0$ for reference. The area element $d\mathbf{A}$ is oriented in the poloidal plane (R-Z plane) and represents the differential cross-sectional area through which toroidal current flows. This surface integral is path-independent due to current continuity and provides the total toroidal current flowing in the plasma.

  Physical significance: Plasma current determines [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profile and affects [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through current-driven instabilities. Current profile shape impacts [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) generation and [current_drive](#current_drive) requirements. Related to [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) and [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) through force balance. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Rogowski_coils](#Rogowski_coils) measure plasma current through magnetic field integration. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Faraday_rotation](#Faraday_rotation) provides current profile constraints. Current evolution follows transformer action and [current_diffusion](#current_diffusion) physics.

  Typical values: 0.1-15 MA in tokamaks depending on device size. ITER: 15 MA nominal. JET: 1-5 MA. DIII-D: 0.5-3 MA. Evolution of $I_p$ determines resistive skin time, [current_ramp](#current_ramp) scenarios, and operational limits.

  Sign convention: Positive current is anti-clockwise when viewed from above (in the direction of increasing toroidal angle $\phi$).
