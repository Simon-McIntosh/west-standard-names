description: Cross-field plasma current in collisional toroidal plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Pfirsch-Schluter current representing cross-field plasma current arising from parallel momentum balance in collisional toroidal plasmas. This current is driven by pressure gradients combined with magnetic field curvature effects, creating a net toroidal current component. Essential for understanding current distribution and force balance in high-collisionality regimes, particularly during current ramp phases and high-density operation. Critical for tokamak operation at high density and low temperature where collisional effects dominate.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{PS} = -\frac{2 p}{B_{\theta}} \frac{\mathbf{B} \times \nabla B \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\phi}}{B^2}$$

  where $p$ is plasma pressure, $B_{\theta}$ is poloidal magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field vector, and $\mathbf{e}_{\phi}$ is toroidal direction unit vector.

  Physical significance: Pfirsch-Schluter current affects [mhd_equilibrium](#mhd_equilibrium) and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) in high-collisionality regimes, particularly during [current_ramp](#current_ramp) and high-density scenarios. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) at high density and during plasma formation phases. Strongly coupled to [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [collisionality](#collisionality), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor). Essential for understanding [current_profile](#current_profile) evolution and force balance in collisional plasmas.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current profiles from magnetic diagnostics including flux loops and magnetic probes. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for pressure calculation. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) for total pressure profiles. Pfirsch-Schluter current calculated from pressure gradients and magnetic geometry using neoclassical formulas. Critical for high-density operation analysis and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $j_{PS} \approx 0.1-0.5$ MA/m$^2$ in high-collisionality scenarios, higher during current ramp. JET: $j_{PS} \approx 0.05-0.3$ MA/m$^2$ at high density. DIII-D: $j_{PS} \approx 0.08-0.4$ MA/m$^2$ in collisional regimes. Higher values at high density and low temperature where [collisionality](#collisionality) is elevated. Range across machines: 0.05-0.5 MA/m$^2$ (mean ~0.2 MA/m$^2$).

  Sign convention: Positive Pfirsch-Schluter current flows in direction of plasma current (counter-clockwise viewing from above), following standard tokamak current conventions.
