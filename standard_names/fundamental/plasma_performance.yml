description: Overall fusion performance metric combining multiple plasma parameters.
documentation: |-
  Plasma performance metric combining fusion power density, energy gain, and confinement quality. Include fusion gain Q, normalized beta $\beta_N$, and confinement factor H. Higher performance enables better tokamak efficiency and fusion power production. Critical for tokamak design and operational optimization. Performance determines economic viability of fusion energy.

  Governing equation:
  $$Q = \frac{P_{fusion}}{P_{auxiliary}}$$

  where $Q$ is fusion gain, $P_{fusion}$ is fusion power, and $P_{auxiliary}$ is auxiliary heating power.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) efficiency and affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) requirements. Higher performance reduces auxiliary power needs and improves tokamak sustainability. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) optimization. Related to [fusion_reactivity](#fusion_reactivity), [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Essential for economic analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures kinetic profiles for performance calculation. [Neutron_diagnostics](#Neutron_diagnostics) measure fusion power. Power balance analysis determines heating requirements. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction supplies geometric constraints. Critical for performance optimization and scenario design.

  Typical values: ITER: Target $Q \approx 10$ (Q=10 scenario), $\beta_N \approx 2.8-3.5$. JET: Record $Q \approx 0.6$ (Q<1), $\beta_N \approx 2.0-3.2$. DIII-D: $Q \approx 0.1-0.3$, $\beta_N \approx 2.5-3.8$. Higher performance enables better fusion energy production.

  Sign convention: Positive performance metrics indicate better fusion capability, following standard plasma physics conventions.
