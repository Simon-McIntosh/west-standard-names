description: Rate of change of safety factor with radius affecting stability and transport.
documentation: |-
  Magnetic shear $\hat{s} = \frac{r}{q} \frac{dq}{dr}$ measuring rate of change of safety factor with radius. Critical parameter affecting MHD stability and transport. Shear stabilization prevents micro-instabilities and improves confinement. Essential for understanding transport barriers and improved confinement modes. Magnetic shear affects bootstrap current and current drive efficiency. Key parameter for tokamak stability analysis and scenario design.

  Governing equation:
  $$\hat{s} = \frac{r}{q} \frac{dq}{dr}$$

  where $r$ is the minor radius, $q$ is the safety factor, and the derivative is taken with respect to radius.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines the stability of plasma configurations and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through stabilization of micro-instabilities. Positive shear $\hat{s} > 0$ typically stabilizes ballooning modes and improves confinement. Critical for H-mode transitions and transport barrier formation. Related to [current_profile](#current_profile) shape and affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) efficiency. Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines $q$-profiles from which shear is calculated. [Current_profile](#current_profile) analysis relates shear to current density gradients. [Motional_Stark_effect](#Motional_Stark_effect) provides direct $q$ measurements for shear calculation. Shear profiles critical for stability analysis and transport modeling. Essential for predicting [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries and operational limits.

  Typical values: Core plasma: $\hat{s} \sim 0.1-0.5$. Edge plasma: $\hat{s} \sim 0.5-2.0$. ITER: $0.05-1.5$ across radius. JET: $0.1-2.5$. DIII-D: $0.08-2.0$. Higher shear generally improves stability but may reduce bootstrap current efficiency.

  Sign convention: Positive shear indicates increasing $q$ with radius, following standard tokamak convention.
