  plasma frequency.
documentation: |-
  Collisionality $\nu_*$ measuring ratio of collision frequency to characteristic plasma frequency. Fundamental parameter determining transport regime and neoclassical effects. Critical for bootstrap current calculations and transport coefficient determination. Collisionality determines banana orbit width and trapped particle effects. Essential for understanding transport transitions and confinement scaling. Key parameter for tokamak operational regime classification.

  Governing equation:
  $$\nu_* = \nu_{ei} \frac{qR}{v_{th,e}}$$

  where $\nu_{ei}$ is electron-ion collision frequency, $q$ is safety factor, $R$ is major radius, and $v_{th,e}$ is electron thermal velocity.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines the neoclassical transport regime and affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) efficiency. High collisionality $\nu_* > 1$ leads to Pfirsch-Schluter transport, while low collisionality $\nu_* < 0.1$ enables banana regime transport. Critical for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) and [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) transitions. Related to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) and determines [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) scaling.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from kinetic profiles using electron density, temperature, and effective charge $Z_{eff}$. [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) determines collisionality profiles from power balance. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) design. Critical parameter for ITER performance predictions and operational boundary determination.

  Typical values: Core plasma: $\nu_* \sim 0.01-0.1$ (banana regime). Edge plasma: $\nu_* \sim 1-10$ (Pfirsch-Schluter regime). ITER: $0.001-1$ across radius depending on scenario. JET: $0.01-5$. DIII-D: $0.005-3$. Lower collisionality enables better confinement and higher bootstrap current.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing relative collision frequency.
