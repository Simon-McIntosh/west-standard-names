description: Internal reconnection events in tokamak plasma core.
documentation: |-
  Sawtooth instability involving periodic internal reconnection events in the tokamak plasma core. MHD instability affecting central safety factor and core plasma parameters. Critical for understanding core transport and maintaining central stability. Sawtooth crashes reset central profiles and affect fusion reactivity. Essential for tokamak operational stability and performance optimization.

  Governing equation:
  $$q_0 = \frac{\tau_{saw}}{\tau_{diffusion}}$$

  where $q_0$ is central safety factor, $\tau_{saw}$ is sawtooth period, and $\tau_{diffusion}$ is diffusion time.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines core [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance). Sawtooth crashes affect central profiles and [fusion_reactivity](#fusion_reactivity). Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design. Related to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure). Essential for core stability control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures central temperature and density profiles. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#Magnetic_diagnostics) detect sawtooth oscillations. [Soft_xray_diagnostics](#Soft_xray_diagnostics) monitor core emissions. [Electron_cyclotron_emission](#Electron_cyclotron_emission) measures temperature fluctuations. Critical for sawtooth control and scenario optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Sawtooth period $\tau_{saw} \approx 50-200$ ms, crash time $\tau_{crash} \approx 100-500$ μs. JET: $\tau_{saw} \approx 20-100$ ms. DIII-D: $\tau_{saw} \approx 10-50$ ms. Shorter periods improve stability.
