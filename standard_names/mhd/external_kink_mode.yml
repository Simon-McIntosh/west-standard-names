description: MHD kink instability involving interaction with conducting vessel walls.
documentation: |-
  External kink mode instability involving interaction between plasma current and conducting vessel walls where plasma current interacts with image currents in conducting structures to drive global instabilities. Critical stability limit for tokamak operation, particularly at high [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and low [safety_factor](#safety_factor) values. Wall stabilization effects depend on wall proximity, conductivity, and magnetic geometry. Essential for determining maximum [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and operational boundaries. External kink analysis critical for tokamak design and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning in all major tokamak devices.

  Governing equation:
  $$\gamma^2 \propto \frac{j_p^2}{B_{\theta}^2} \left(1 - \frac{B_{wall}}{B_{\theta}}\right)$$

  where $j_p$ is plasma current density, $B_{\theta}$ is poloidal magnetic field, and $B_{wall}$ is stabilizing field from conducting wall.

  Physical significance: External kink modes determine fundamental stability limits and directly affect [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) boundaries in tokamak plasmas. These modes can lead to plasma-wall contact and operational disruptions. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [plasma_current](#plasma_current), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor). Essential for operational safety and scenario design in high-performance regimes.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines plasma-wall interactions and image current effects. [Mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) codes calculate external kink growth rates including wall effects. [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide constraints on wall proximity and stabilization. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures profiles for coupled stability analysis. Critical for operational limit determination and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization with wall stabilization.

  Typical values: ITER: Maximum stable $q_{95} \approx 2.5-3.5$ for external kink modes with optimized wall positioning. JET: $q_{95} \approx 2.0-3.2$ with conducting wall effects. DIII-D: $q_{95} \approx 2.2-3.0$ with nearby conducting structures. Wall stabilization enables operation at lower [safety_factor](#safety_factor) values. Range across machines: $q_{95}$ 2.0-3.5 (mean ~2.8).

  Sign convention: Positive growth rates indicate unstable modes, following standard MHD stability conventions where $\gamma > 0$ represents exponentially growing external kinks.
