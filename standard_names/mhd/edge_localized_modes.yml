description: Edge plasma instabilities in H-mode tokamak operation.
documentation: |-
  Edge localized modes (ELMs) periodic instabilities occurring in H-mode tokamak operation. MHD instabilities at the plasma edge affecting transport and heat flux to the divertor. Critical for understanding H-mode physics and divertor heat load management. ELMs provide periodic energy and particle transport from the edge pedestal. Essential for tokamak operational stability and divertor design.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta W_{ELM} \propto \beta_{ped}$$

  where $\Delta W_{ELM}$ is ELM energy loss and $\beta_{ped}$ is pedestal beta.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [h_mode](#h_mode) stability and affects [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) limits. ELMs manage edge pressure buildup but can cause divertor heat loads. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability). Related to [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal), [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Essential for H-mode operation control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_diagnostics](#Magnetic_diagnostics) measure ELM signatures. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures edge profiles and pedestal structure. [Interferometry](#interferometry) detects density perturbations. [Divertor_diagnostics](#Divertor_diagnostics) measure heat loads. Critical for ELM control and divertor optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Type I ELM energy loss $\Delta W_{ELM} \approx 5-15$ MJ per ELM. JET: $\Delta W_{ELM} \approx 0.5-2.0$ MJ. DIII-D: $\Delta W_{ELM} \approx 0.2-0.8$ MJ. ELM frequency affects divertor heat loads.
