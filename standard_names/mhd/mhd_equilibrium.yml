description: MHD equilibrium state of plasma in magnetic confinement device.
documentation: MHD equilibrium representing the force balance condition $\nabla p
  = \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{B}$ in magnetically confined plasma. In tokamaks, results
  in nested flux surfaces with closed magnetic field lines. Described by the Grad-Shafranov
  equation which relates pressure, current, and magnetic field profiles. Essential
  for interpreting all diagnostic measurements and predicting plasma behavior. Equilibrium
  reconstruction combines magnetic sensors, kinetic profiles, and equilibrium codes
  to solve for plasma parameters.
