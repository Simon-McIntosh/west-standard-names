description: Total electron pressure including thermal and non-thermal contributions.
documentation: 'Total electron pressure $p_e$ including contributions from both thermal
  (Maxwellian) and non-thermal (fast, runaway) electron populations.


  For an isotropic distribution, the pressure is related to the kinetic energy density.
  The total electron pressure contributes to the MHD force balance:


  $$\mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{B} = \nabla (p_e + p_i)$$


  where $p_i$ is the ion pressure and $\mathbf{j}$ is the current density. Electron
  pressure gradients drive transport and affect MHD stability.'
