name: electron_temperature
description: Electron temperature in plasma.
documentation: 'Electron temperature $T_e$ representing the average kinetic energy
  of electrons in the plasma. Related to the electron thermal velocity by:


  $$v_{th,e} = \sqrt{\frac{2 T_e}{m_e}}$$


  where $m_e$ is the electron mass.


  Electron temperature is typically measured by Thomson scattering, electron cyclotron
  emission (ECE), or charge exchange spectroscopy. In tokamak core plasmas, $T_e$
  ranges from ~100 eV to 10+ keV. Temperature profiles are crucial for transport analysis,
  fusion reactivity calculations, and plasma confinement studies.'
