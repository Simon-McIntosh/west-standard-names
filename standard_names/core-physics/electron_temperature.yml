name: electron_temperature
description: Electron temperature in plasma.
documentation: |-
  Electron temperature $T_e$ representing the average kinetic energy of electrons in the plasma. Fundamental plasma parameter determining thermal velocity, fusion reactivity, and transport coefficients. Related to electron thermal velocity by $v_{th,e} = \sqrt{\frac{2 T_e}{m_e}}$ where $m_e$ is the electron mass.

  Governing equation:
  $$v_{th,e} = \sqrt{\frac{2 T_e}{m_e}}$$

  where $T_e$ is electron temperature in eV, $m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg is electron mass, giving thermal velocity in m/s.

  Physical significance: Electron temperature determines fusion reactivity through the [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and affects [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) via Spitzer formula. Higher temperature improves confinement through reduced [collisionality](#collisionality) but increases [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) requirements. Temperature gradients drive [electron_heat_flux](#electron_heat_flux) and affect [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) generation. Related to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [electron_pressure](#electron_pressure).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures electron temperature from scattered laser light spectrum width. [Electron_cyclotron_emission](#electron_cyclotron_emission) provides temperature measurements from blackbody radiation. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) gives complementary temperature data. Temperature profiles are crucial for [transport_modeling](#transport_modeling) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction.

  Typical values: Tokamak core plasmas: ~100 eV to 10+ keV. ITER: 1-25 keV. JET: 0.5-20 keV. DIII-D: 0.8-15 keV. Edge temperatures typically 50-500 eV. Temperature profiles are crucial for [fusion_reactivity](#fusion_reactivity) and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) calculations.

  Sign convention: Positive temperature indicates thermal energy, following standard plasma physics conventions.
