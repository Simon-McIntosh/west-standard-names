name: thermal_electron_density
description: Electron number density of thermal (Maxwellian) population only.
documentation: 'Thermal electron density $n_{e,th}$ representing only the Maxwellian
  (thermalized) component of the electron population, excluding non-thermal populations
  such as runaway electrons or beam-injected fast electrons.


  The thermal density satisfies $n_{e,th} \leq n_e$ where $n_e$ is the total electron
  density. In most tokamak plasmas, non-thermal populations are negligible and $n_{e,th}
  \approx n_e$.


  Thermal density is used in calculating thermal pressure $p_{e,th} = n_{e,th} T_e$
  and in transport analysis where non-thermal particles must be treated separately.'
