description: Ion temperature in plasma representing average kinetic energy of ions.
documentation: "Ion temperature $T_i$ representing the average kinetic energy of ions\
  \ in the plasma. Related to ion thermal velocity by $v_{th,i} = \\sqrt{\frac{2 T_i}{m_i}}$\
  \ where $m_i$ is the ion mass. Ion temperature affects fusion reactivity, transport\
  \ coefficients, and plasma pressure. Measured by charge exchange spectroscopy, neutron\
  \ diagnostics, and ion cyclotron emission. In tokamak core plasmas, $T_i$ ranges\
  \ from ~100 eV to 10+ keV. Ion temperature profiles crucial for transport analysis,\
  \ fusion power calculations, and MHD stability. Often differs from electron temperature\
  \ due to different heating mechanisms and transport properties."
