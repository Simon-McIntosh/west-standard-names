description: Statistical weight assigned to measured electron temperature values in
  profile fitting.
documentation: 'Weight $w_i$ assigned to each measured electron temperature value
  in the fitting process used to construct smooth radial profiles from discrete measurements.


  Weights are typically based on measurement uncertainty: $w_i = 1/\sigma_i^2$ where
  $\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of measurement $i$. Higher weights are given
  to more accurate measurements.


  Used in least-squares minimization to obtain fitted profiles. The weighted chi-squared
  is:


  $$\chi^2 = \sum_i w_i^2 \frac{(T_{fit,i} - T_{meas,i})^2}{\sigma_i^2}$$'
