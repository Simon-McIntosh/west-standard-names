description: Effective plasma charge number characterizing average ion charge state.
documentation: 'Effective charge number $Z_{eff}$ defined as:


  $$Z_{eff} = \frac{\sum_i n_i Z_i^2}{\sum_i n_i Z_i} = \frac{\sum_i n_i Z_i^2}{n_e}$$


  where the sum is over all ion species with density $n_i$ and charge $Z_i$, and $n_e$
  is the electron density.


  $Z_{eff}$ characterizes the average ion charge state and impurity content. Pure
  deuterium plasma has $Z_{eff} = 1$, while impurities increase $Z_{eff}$. Higher
  $Z_{eff}$ increases plasma resistivity and bremsstrahlung radiation but can improve
  energy confinement. Typical values: 1.5-3.0.'
