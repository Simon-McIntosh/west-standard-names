description: Chi-squared goodness-of-fit metric for electron temperature profile fitting.
documentation: 'Chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic for electron temperature profile
  fitting, defined as:


  $$\chi^2_i = w_i^2 \frac{(T_{fit,i} - T_{meas,i})^2}{\sigma_i^2}$$


  where $w_i$ is the weight, $T_{fit,i}$ is the reconstructed value, $T_{meas,i}$
  is the measured value, and $\sigma_i$ is the measurement standard deviation.


  A reduced chi-squared $\chi^2_{red} = \sum_i \chi^2_i / N_{dof}$ near 1.0 indicates
  a good fit consistent with measurement uncertainties. Values much larger than 1
  suggest systematic discrepancies or underestimated errors.'
