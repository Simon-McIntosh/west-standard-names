description: Thermal electron pressure from random thermal motion only.
documentation: |-
  Thermal electron pressure $p_{e,th}$ associated with random thermal motion of the Maxwellian electron population, defined as:

  $$p_{e,th} = n_{e,th} k_B T_e$$

  where $n_{e,th}$ is the thermal electron density (in m$^{-3}$), $k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature (in K).

  This quantity represents the pressure from thermal motion $\sim \langle (v - \langle v \rangle)^2 \rangle$ and excludes directed motion and non-thermal populations. It is the primary contribution to electron pressure in most tokamak plasmas.

  Note: In plasma physics, temperature is often expressed in electronvolts (eV) where 1 eV = 11605 K. When using $T_e$ in eV, the pressure can be expressed as $p_{e,th} = n_{e,th} T_e \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ Pa.
