description: Thermal electron pressure from random thermal motion only.
documentation: 'Thermal electron pressure $p_{e,th}$ associated with random thermal
  motion of the Maxwellian electron population, defined as:


  $$p_{e,th} = n_{e,th} k_B T_e = n_{e,th} T_e \text{ [eV]}$$


  where $n_{e,th}$ is the thermal electron density and $T_e$ is the electron temperature.


  This quantity represents the pressure from thermal motion $\sim \langle (v - \langle
  v \rangle)^2 \rangle$ and excludes directed motion and non-thermal populations.
  It is the primary contribution to electron pressure in most tokamak plasmas.'
