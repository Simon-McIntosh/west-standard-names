description: Electron temperature value reconstructed from fitting procedure.
documentation: 'Electron temperature $T_{e,fit}$ reconstructed from fitting measured
  values to a smooth functional form (e.g., polynomial, spline, or physics-based parametric
  model).


  The reconstructed values are evaluated at the measurement locations to assess fit
  quality by comparison with the measured values. The difference between reconstructed
  and measured values, weighted by measurement uncertainty, gives the chi-squared
  metric.


  For line-integrated measurements (e.g., ECE with significant chord averaging), the
  reconstructed value represents the line-integrated quantity rather than a local
  temperature.'
