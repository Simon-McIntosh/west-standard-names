name: electron_density
description: Total electron number density including thermal and non-thermal populations.
documentation: 'Electron number density $n_e$ representing the total concentration
  of electrons per unit volume, including both thermal (Maxwellian) and non-thermal
  (e.g., runaway, beam-injected) populations.


  Electron density is measured by interferometry, Thomson scattering, reflectometry,
  and other diagnostics. In tokamak core plasmas, typical values range from $10^{19}$
  to $10^{21}$ m$^{-3}$.


  The electron density determines plasma collisionality, refractivity for electromagnetic
  waves, and appears in the plasma frequency:


  $$\omega_{pe} = \sqrt{\frac{n_e e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}}$$'
