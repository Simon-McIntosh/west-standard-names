description: Volume-averaged effective charge estimated from ohmic flux consumption.
documentation: 'Volume-averaged effective charge $\langle Z_{eff} \rangle_V$ estimated
  from the resistive flux consumption during the ohmic heating phase.


  During ohmic-only operation, the loop voltage is related to plasma resistance, which
  depends on $Z_{eff}$ through the Spitzer resistivity:


  $$\eta_{Spitzer} \propto Z_{eff} T_e^{-3/2}$$


  By measuring the loop voltage, plasma current, and electron temperature profile
  during ohmic phase, $Z_{eff}$ can be inferred from the global resistive dissipation.
  This method provides a spatially-averaged value and is most reliable when other
  heating sources are minimal.'
