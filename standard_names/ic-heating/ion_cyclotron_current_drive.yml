description: Current drive mechanism using ion cyclotron waves to generate non-inductive
  plasma current.
documentation: |-
  Ion cyclotron current drive (ICCD) representing current drive mechanism using ion cyclotron frequency waves to generate non-inductive plasma current through resonant wave-particle interactions in magnetized plasmas. This current drive method operates at frequencies matching ion cyclotron resonances and can provide both current drive and ion heating simultaneously. ICCD is particularly effective for driving current at high ion temperatures and is essential for achieving steady-state tokamak operation with reduced auxiliary power requirements.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{ICCD} = \frac{e n_i v_{ti}^2}{\omega_{ci}} \frac{P_{absorbed}}{T_i} \eta_{IC}$$

  where $j_{ICCD}$ is ICCD current density, $e$ is elementary charge, $n_i$ is ion density, $v_{ti}$ is ion thermal velocity, $\omega_{ci}$ is ion cyclotron frequency, $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $T_i$ is ion temperature, and $\eta_{IC}$ is ICCD efficiency.

  Physical significance: Ion cyclotron current drive determines [current_drive](#current_drive) effectiveness and directly affects [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) capabilities in tokamak plasmas. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through efficient non-inductive current drive. Strongly coupled to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through resonance conditions. Essential for advanced tokamak scenarios requiring high bootstrap fractions and efficient current drive.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) profiles for ICCD efficiency calculations. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance locations and wave accessibility. ICCD modeling codes calculate current drive efficiency based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Current_profile](#current_profile) measurements validate current drive effectiveness. Critical for [current_drive](#current_drive) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: ICCD efficiency $\eta_{IC} \approx 0.05-0.15$ A/W at 25-55 MHz for deuterium-tritium operation. JET: $\eta_{IC} \approx 0.03-0.12$ A/W at 25-48 MHz. DIII-D: $\eta_{IC} \approx 0.02-0.10$ A/W at 30-65 MHz. Higher efficiency at elevated [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) > 5 keV and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 0.02-0.15 A/W (mean ~0.08 A/W).

  Sign convention: Positive ICCD drives current in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above), with sign depending on wave frequency and magnetic field orientation.
