name: frequency_of_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Operating frequency of ion cyclotron heating antenna system.
documentation: Radio frequency at which the ion cyclotron heating antenna operates,
  typically in the range of 25-100 MHz for tokamak plasmas. The frequency is tuned
  to match ion cyclotron resonance conditions for efficient heating and current drive.
  This is the average frequency across all modules of the antenna system.
