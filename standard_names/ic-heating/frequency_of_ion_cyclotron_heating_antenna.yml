description: Operating frequency of ion cyclotron heating antenna system.
documentation: |-
  Radio frequency $f_{ICH}$ at which the ion cyclotron heating antenna system operates, typically in the range of 25-100 MHz for tokamak plasmas. The frequency is precisely tuned to match ion cyclotron resonance conditions for efficient heating and current drive, calculated as $f_{ci} = \omega_{ci}/2\pi = eB/2\pi m_i$. This represents the average frequency across all modules of the antenna system.

  Governing equation:
  $$f_{ci} = \frac{eB}{2\pi m_i} = \frac{1.52 \times 10^4 Z}{A} B\ \text{[Hz]}$$

  where $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C is elementary charge, $B$ is magnetic field in T, $Z$ is ion charge number, $A$ is atomic mass number, and $m_i = A \times 1.673 \times 10^{-27}$ kg is ion mass.

  Physical significance: This frequency determines [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and resonance absorption in the plasma. Precise frequency control is critical for matching cyclotron resonances at different magnetic field locations. Affects [current_drive](#current_drive) capabilities and heating localization. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through resonance conditions. Essential for achieving optimal [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and energy balance in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance frequencies at different plasma locations. Antenna system measurements provide direct frequency monitoring. Power absorption analysis validates frequency tuning efficiency. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures ion temperature responses to verify heating effectiveness.

  Typical values: ITER: 25.7 MHz (D), 37.5 MHz (T), 51.3 MHz (³He) at 5.3 T. JET: 25-48 MHz for D-T operation at 3.4-3.8 T. DIII-D: 30-65 MHz for various magnetic field strengths and ion species combinations.

  Sign convention: Positive frequency indicates the fundamental ion cyclotron resonance, with harmonics at integer multiples for multi-ion heating scenarios.
