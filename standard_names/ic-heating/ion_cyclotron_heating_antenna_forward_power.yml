description: Forward RF power arriving at the back of an ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: |-
  Forward radio frequency power measured at the back of an individual antenna module, before entering the plasma-facing structures. This measurement is typically obtained from directional couplers in the transmission line. The difference between forward and reflected power gives the net power delivered to the plasma.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{forward} = \frac{|V|^2}{2Z_0}$$

  where $V$ is the RF voltage amplitude and $Z_0$ is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line (typically 50 $\Omega$).

  Physical significance: This quantity determines the available [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) power and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and energy balance calculations. Forward power represents the maximum possible heating power available to the plasma before coupling losses. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) monitoring and [plasma_control](#plasma_control) applications. Strongly coupled to [antenna_efficiency](#antenna_efficiency), [transmission_line_losses](#transmission_line_losses), and [power_amplifier](#power_amplifier) performance. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [energy_confinement](#energy_confinement) studies.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Directional couplers provide real-time forward power measurements with high accuracy (±1%). [Power_monitoring](#power_monitoring) systems integrate forward power over time for energy delivery calculations. [RF_voltage_probe](#RF_voltage_probe) measures voltage amplitudes for power calculation verification. [Transmission_line_analysis](#transmission_line_analysis) accounts for losses between amplifiers and antenna. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) protection and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Up to 6.25 MW forward power per antenna module (8 modules total). JET: Up to 6.25 MW per antenna (4 antennas total). DIII-D: Up to 1.5 MW per antenna module depending on configuration. Power levels controlled to ±1% accuracy for precise plasma heating. Forward power densities 0.5-2.5 MW/m² at antenna aperture.

  Sign convention: Positive forward power indicates energy flow from RF amplifiers toward plasma, with higher values enabling greater heating capability and improved plasma performance.
