name: voltage_phase_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Phase angle of voltage signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: Phase of the RF voltage signal at the antenna module. Phase relationship
  between voltage and current determines the reactive and resistive components of
  antenna impedance. Used for impedance matching analysis and antenna tuning optimization.
