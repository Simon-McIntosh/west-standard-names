description: Position vector defining antenna strap outline geometry in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: Three-dimensional position vector (R, φ, Z) defining the outline contour
  of an ion cyclotron heating antenna strap. The outline consists of multiple position
  points that trace the strap geometry. This information is used for electromagnetic
  modeling, plasma-antenna coupling calculations, and visualization of antenna placement
  relative to plasma.
