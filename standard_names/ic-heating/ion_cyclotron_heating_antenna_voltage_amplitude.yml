name: ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna_voltage_amplitude
description: Amplitude of voltage signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: |-
  Amplitude of the RF voltage signal measured at the antenna module. Voltage measurements, combined with current measurements, provide information about antenna impedance and coupling efficiency. High voltages (tens of kV) can lead to voltage breakdown and arcing, limiting operational capability.

  Governing equation:
  $$V_{antenna} = \sqrt{2 Z_0 P_{forward}}$$

  where $V_{antenna}$ is voltage amplitude, $Z_0$ is characteristic impedance (50 $\Omega$), and $P_{forward}$ is forward power.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and [antenna_performance](#antenna_performance). Voltage amplitude determines electromagnetic field strength and coupling to plasma. Critical for [voltage_breakdown](#voltage_breakdown) analysis and [heating_system](#heating_system) protection. Strongly coupled to [antenna_current_amplitude](#antenna_current_amplitude), [power_density](#power_density), and [electric_field](#electric_field) strength. Essential for [antenna_design](#antenna_design) and [system_reliability](#system_reliability) in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [RF_voltage_probes](#RF_voltage_probes) measure voltage amplitudes with high accuracy (±2%). [Voltage_dividers](#voltage_dividers) provide safe voltage monitoring. [Peak_voltage_meters](#peak_voltage_meters) track maximum voltage levels. [Antenna_monitoring](#antenna_monitoring) systems use voltage data for protection algorithms. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) interlocks and [breakdown_prevention](#breakdown_prevention).

  Typical values: ITER: Peak voltages 10-50 kV depending on power level and frequency. JET: Typical voltages 5-30 kV for standard operations. DIII-D: Operating range 3-20 kV depending on antenna configuration. Voltage limits determined by breakdown thresholds and insulation ratings.

  Sign convention: Positive voltage amplitude indicates peak RF voltage relative to ground, with magnitude determining electric field strength and breakdown risk.
