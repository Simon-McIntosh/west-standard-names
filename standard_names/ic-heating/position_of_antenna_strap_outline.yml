description: Position vector defining antenna strap outline geometry in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, \u03C6, Z) defining the outline\
  \ contour of an ion cyclotron heating antenna strap. The outline consists of multiple\
  \ position points that trace the strap geometry. This information is used for electromagnetic\
  \ modeling, plasma-antenna coupling calculations, and visualization of antenna placement\
  \ relative to plasma."
