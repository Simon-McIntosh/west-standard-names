description: Total RF power launched into the vacuum vessel from ion cyclotron heating
  antenna.
documentation: |-
  Total radio frequency power $P_{launched}$ launched from the ion cyclotron heating antenna system into the vacuum vessel, representing the net power entering the plasma after transmission line losses but before plasma absorption. This quantity is calculated as the sum of power from all antenna modules minus reflected power, representing the power available for plasma heating.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{launched} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{forward,i} - P_{reflected}$$

  where $P_{forward,i}$ is forward power to antenna module $i$, $P_{reflected}$ is total reflected power, and $N$ is the number of antenna modules.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines the available [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) power and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and energy balance calculations. Higher launched power enables better [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) control and [current_drive](#current_drive) capabilities. Strongly coupled to antenna efficiency, plasma loading, and reflection coefficients. Critical for tokamak scenario optimization and heating system performance. Related to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through plasma loading effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Antenna power monitoring systems measure forward and reflected power levels. Calibrated directional couplers provide accurate power measurements. Transmission line analysis accounts for losses. [Ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency calculations use launched power as input. Real-time power feedback enables controlled heating scenarios.

  Typical values: ITER: Up to 50 MW total launched power from 8 antenna modules (~6.25 MW per module). JET: Up to 25 MW from 4 antennas (~6.25 MW per module). DIII-D: Up to 6 MW from multiple antenna configurations. Power densities 1-5 MW/m³ in core plasma regions.

  Sign convention: Positive power indicates energy flow from antenna system to plasma, with reflection losses reducing net available power for heating.
