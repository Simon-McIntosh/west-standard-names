name: toroidal_width_of_antenna_strap
description: Width of antenna strap in the toroidal direction.
documentation: 'Toroidal extent of the antenna strap conductor. Wider straps provide
  better coupling but may have different spectral properties. This parameter affects
  the toroidal wave number spectrum of the launched RF power. Note: This field is
  marked obsolescent in IMAS Data Dictionary version 3.42.0.'
