name: current_amplitude_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Amplitude of current signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: Amplitude of the RF current signal measured at the antenna module.
  Current distribution across antenna straps determines the launched wave spectrum.
  High currents (hundreds to thousands of amperes) can cause ohmic heating in antenna
  components and structural stresses.
