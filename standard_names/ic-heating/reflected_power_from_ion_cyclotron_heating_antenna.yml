name: reflected_power_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Reflected RF power from an ion cyclotron heating antenna module.
documentation: Radio frequency power reflected back from the antenna module due to
  impedance mismatch between the antenna and plasma. High reflected power indicates
  poor coupling conditions and can damage transmission line components. Typical reflection
  coefficients range from 5-30% depending on plasma conditions and antenna tuning.
