name: ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna_pressure_amplitude
description: Amplitude of pressure measurement at ion cyclotron heating antenna module.
documentation: |-
  Pressure measured near the antenna module, typically in the transmission line or matching network. Pressure variations can indicate vacuum leaks, gas puffing effects, or plasma-antenna interactions. Monitoring pressure is important for preventing arcing and maintaining operational reliability.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{vacuum} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{N}{m^2}$$

  where $P_{vacuum}$ is vacuum pressure, $F$ is force, and $A$ is cross-sectional area of the transmission line.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) system reliability and [antenna_protection](#antenna_protection). Pressure levels determine breakdown voltage and arcing thresholds. Critical for [vacuum_system](#vacuum_system) monitoring and [heating_system](#heating_system) safety. Strongly coupled to [gas_injection](#gas_injection), [plasma_wall_interaction](#plasma_wall_interaction), and [breakdown_voltage](#breakdown_voltage) characteristics. Essential for [operational_reliability](#operational_reliability) and [system_protection](#system_protection) in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Pirani_gauges](#Pirani_gauges) measure pressure in the 10⁻³ to 10³ Pa range with ±5% accuracy. [Ionization_gauges](#ionization_gauges) provide high-vacuum measurements below 10⁻² Pa. [Pressure_transducers](#pressure_transducers) monitor real-time pressure variations. [Vacuum_system](#vacuum_system) controllers use pressure feedback for system protection. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) interlocks and [antenna_safety](#antenna_safety) protocols.

  Typical values: ITER: Operating pressure < 10⁻⁶ Pa for optimal RF performance, < 10⁻⁴ Pa for safe operation. JET: Typical pressures 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ Pa during heating. DIII-D: Operating range 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻³ Pa depending on plasma conditions. Pressure spikes > 10⁻² Pa indicate potential system issues.

  Sign convention: Positive pressure indicates force per unit area exerted on antenna structures, with higher pressures reducing breakdown voltage and increasing arcing risk.
