description: Heating mechanism using ion cyclotron frequency waves to energize ions.
documentation: |-
  Ion cyclotron heating (ICH) representing radio frequency heating mechanism using ion cyclotron frequency waves to energize ions through resonant absorption in magnetized plasmas. This essential heating mechanism operates at frequencies matching the ion cyclotron resonance condition $\omega_{ci} = eB/m_i$, where $\omega_{ci}$ is the ion cyclotron frequency, $e$ is elementary charge, $B$ is magnetic field strength, and $m_i$ is ion mass. ICH is particularly effective for bulk ion heating and achieving high ion temperatures required for fusion conditions.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{absorbed} = \frac{2\pi^2 r_e n_e}{\omega_{ci}} \frac{\omega^2}{\omega^2 - \omega_{ci}^2} |E_+|^2$$

  where $r_e$ is the classical electron radius, $n_e$ is electron density, $\omega$ is the wave frequency, and $E_+$ is the electric field component.

  Physical significance: ICH determines ion heating efficiency and directly affects [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) in tokamak operation. Critical for achieving fusion conditions through bulk ion heating, particularly effective at high [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) strength. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) through resonance conditions. Essential for advanced tokamak scenarios requiring high ion temperatures and [current_drive](#current_drive) capabilities.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures ion temperature profiles for ICH efficiency analysis. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance locations and wave accessibility. ICH modeling codes calculate power deposition and heating profiles based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides complementary ion temperature data for ICH validation.

  Typical values: ITER: ICH frequencies 25-55 MHz for deuterium-tritium operation at 5.3 T. JET: 25-48 MHz for various ion species. DIII-D: 30-65 MHz depending on magnetic field and ion species. Heating efficiency typically 60-80% with power densities of 1-5 MW/m³.

  Sign convention: Positive heating power indicates energy transfer to plasma ions, following standard heating physics conventions.
