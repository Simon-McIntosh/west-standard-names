description: Total RF power launched into the vacuum vessel from ion cyclotron heating
  antenna.
documentation: Total radio frequency power launched from the ion cyclotron heating
  antenna system into the vacuum vessel. This represents the net power entering the
  plasma after transmission line losses but before plasma absorption. Calculated as
  the sum of power from all antenna modules minus reflected power. Used for energy
  balance calculations and heating efficiency analysis.
