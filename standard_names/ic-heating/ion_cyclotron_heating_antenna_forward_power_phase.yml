description: Phase angle of forward RF power relative to first module in antenna array.
documentation: 'Phase of the forward power signal measured at an antenna module, referenced
  to the first module in the array. Phase differences between modules determine the
  toroidal mode number $n_{\phi}$ of the launched wave spectrum and control the direction
  of wave propagation. Typical phasing schemes: monopole (0°), dipole (180°), or traveling
  wave (90°/270°).'
