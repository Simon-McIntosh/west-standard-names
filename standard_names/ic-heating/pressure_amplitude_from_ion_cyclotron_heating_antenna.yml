name: pressure_amplitude_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Amplitude of pressure measurement at ion cyclotron heating antenna module.
documentation: Pressure measured near the antenna module, typically in the transmission
  line or matching network. Pressure variations can indicate vacuum leaks, gas puffing
  effects, or plasma-antenna interactions. Monitoring pressure is important for preventing
  arcing and maintaining operational reliability.
