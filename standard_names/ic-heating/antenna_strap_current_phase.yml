description: Phase angle of current flowing through individual antenna strap.
documentation: |-
  Phase of the RF current in an individual antenna strap. Multiple straps in an antenna module are typically fed with controlled phase relationships to optimize the launched wave spectrum. The phase distribution determines the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers of the excited waves, controlling wave propagation direction and plasma heating location.

  Governing equation:
  $$\phi_{strap,i} = \phi_0 + \Delta\phi \cdot (i-1)$$

  where $\phi_{strap,i}$ is the phase of strap $i$, $\phi_0$ is the reference phase, $\Delta\phi$ is the phase step between adjacent straps, and $i$ is the strap index.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly controls [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) wave propagation direction and [current_drive](#current_drive) efficiency. Phase relationships determine launched wave spectrum and coupling to specific plasma regions. Critical for [wave_spectrum](#wave_spectrum) optimization and [heating_localization](#heating_localization). Strongly coupled to [antenna_array](#antenna_array), [mode_control](#mode_control), and [plasma_modes](#plasma_modes) performance. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and advanced [heating_control](#heating_control) strategies.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Phase_monitoring](#phase_monitoring) systems measure relative phases between antenna straps with high accuracy (±2°). [Wave_spectrum_analysis](#wave_spectrum_analysis) calculates expected mode numbers from phase relationships. [Heating_efficiency](#heating_efficiency) studies correlate phase with plasma response. [Antenna_modeling](#antenna_modeling) predicts phase-dependent performance. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) optimization and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) enhancement.

  Typical values: ITER: Phase control from 0° to 360° per strap with ±2° accuracy. JET: Monopole (0°), dipole (180°), and traveling wave (90°/270°) schemes. DIII-D: Configurable phase steps of 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180° between straps. Phase stability critical for consistent heating performance.

  Sign convention: Positive phase angles advance wave propagation direction and enable directional [current_drive](#current_drive) capability, measured relative to reference strap.
