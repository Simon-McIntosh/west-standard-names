name: voltage_amplitude_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Amplitude of voltage signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: Amplitude of the RF voltage signal measured at the antenna module.
  Voltage measurements, combined with current measurements, provide information about
  antenna impedance and coupling efficiency. High voltages (tens of kV) can lead to
  voltage breakdown and arcing, limiting operational capability.
