name: distance_to_conductor_from_antenna_strap
description: Distance from antenna strap to conducting wall or conductor behind the
  strap.
documentation: Distance between the antenna strap and the conducting structure (wall
  or Faraday shield) behind it. This distance affects the antenna inductance and coupling
  impedance. Typical values range from a few cm to tens of cm. Used in electromagnetic
  modeling of antenna properties.
