description: Phase angle of voltage signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: |-
  Phase of the RF voltage signal at the antenna module. Phase relationship between voltage and current determines the reactive and resistive components of antenna impedance. Used for impedance matching analysis and antenna tuning optimization.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{antenna} = \frac{V_{antenna}}{I_{antenna}} = |Z| \angle \phi = R + jX$$

  where $Z_{antenna}$ is antenna impedance, $V_{antenna}$ is voltage amplitude, $I_{antenna}$ is current amplitude, $\phi$ is the phase angle, $R$ is resistance, and $X$ is reactance.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and [antenna_matching](#antenna_matching) performance. Voltage phase determines reactive power flow and impedance characteristics. Critical for [matching_network](#matching_network) optimization and [heating_system](#heating_system) stability. Strongly coupled to [antenna_current_phase](#antenna_current_phase), [plasma_impedance](#plasma_impedance), and [voltage_standing_wave_ratio](#voltage_standing_wave_ratio). Essential for [antenna_tuning](#antenna_tuning) and [power_transfer](#power_transfer) optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Vector_network_analyzers](#vector_network_analyzers) measure voltage and current phase relationships with high accuracy (±1°). [RF_voltage_probes](#RF_voltage_probes) provide phase reference measurements. [Impedance_monitoring](#impedance_monitoring) systems track phase variations. [Matching_network](#matching_network) controllers use phase feedback for optimization. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) protection and [antenna_performance](#antenna_performance) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: Voltage phases 0° to 360° with ±1° accuracy for optimal matching. JET: Phase control range ±180° for impedance matching. DIII-D: Typical phases 45° to 135° depending on plasma loading. Phase stability critical for consistent heating performance and system reliability.

  Sign convention: Positive phase angles indicate voltage leading current in capacitive circuits, with phase relationships determining reactive power flow and impedance matching efficiency.
