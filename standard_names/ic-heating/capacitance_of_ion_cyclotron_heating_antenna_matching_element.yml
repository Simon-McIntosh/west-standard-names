description: Capacitance value of impedance matching element in ion cyclotron heating
  system.
documentation: |-
  Capacitance of a tunable matching element used to optimize impedance matching between the transmission line and the antenna. Matching networks typically use vacuum variable capacitors that can be adjusted during operation to minimize reflected power. Capacitance values typically range from hundreds of pF to several nF.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{match} = \frac{1}{j\omega C} + Z_{load}$$

  where $Z_{match}$ is matched impedance, $\omega = 2\pi f$ is angular frequency, $C$ is capacitance, and $Z_{load}$ is load impedance.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and [antenna_matching](#antenna_matching) performance. Capacitance tuning optimizes power transfer and minimizes reflections. Critical for [matching_network](#matching_network) optimization and [heating_system](#heating_system) stability. Strongly coupled to [reflected_power](#reflected_power), [impedance_matching](#impedance_matching), and [power_efficiency](#power_efficiency). Essential for [real_time_tuning](#real_time_tuning) and [adaptive_matching](#adaptive_matching) in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Capacitance_meters](#capacitance_meters) measure capacitance values with ±1% accuracy. [Network_analyzers](#network_analyzers) determine optimal capacitance for matching. [Matching_controllers](#matching_controllers) adjust capacitance in real-time. [Impedance_monitoring](#impedance_monitoring) systems track matching performance. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) optimization and [antenna_protection](#antenna_protection).

  Typical values: ITER: Capacitance range 100 pF to 5 nF for 25-100 MHz operation. JET: 200 pF to 3 nF depending on frequency. DIII-D: 50 pF to 2 nF for various antenna configurations. Tuning precision ±1% for optimal matching performance.

  Sign convention: Positive capacitance indicates energy storage capability of matching element, with larger values reducing resonant frequency and improving low-frequency matching.
