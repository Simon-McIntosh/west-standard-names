description: Capacitance value of impedance matching element in ion cyclotron heating
  system.
documentation: Capacitance of a tunable matching element used to optimize impedance
  matching between the transmission line and the antenna. Matching networks typically
  use vacuum variable capacitors that can be adjusted during operation to minimize
  reflected power. Capacitance values typically range from hundreds of pF to several
  nF.
