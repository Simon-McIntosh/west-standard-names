description: Reflected RF power from an ion cyclotron heating antenna module.
documentation: |-
  Radio frequency power reflected back from the antenna module due to impedance mismatch between the antenna and plasma. High reflected power indicates poor coupling conditions and can damage transmission line components. Typical reflection coefficients range from 5-30% depending on plasma conditions and antenna tuning.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{reflected} = |\Gamma|^2 \cdot P_{forward}$$

  where $\Gamma$ is the complex reflection coefficient and $P_{forward}$ is the forward power.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and system performance. High reflected power indicates poor [antenna-plasma coupling](#antenna-plasma_coupling) and can lead to [voltage_standing_wave_ratio](#voltage_standing_wave_ratio) issues. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) protection and optimization. Strongly coupled to [antenna_impedance](#antenna_impedance), [plasma_surface_resistance](#plasma_surface_resistance), and [matching_network](#matching_network) performance. Affects overall [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through reduced heating efficiency.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Directional couplers in transmission lines measure forward and reflected power levels simultaneously. Complex reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ calculated from voltage/current measurements at antenna feed points. [Antenna_matching](#antenna_matching) systems use reflected power feedback for real-time optimization. [Impedance_monitoring](#impedance_monitoring) systems track coupling efficiency. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) protection algorithms.

  Typical values: ITER: Up to 15 MW reflected power (30% of 50 MW forward power). JET: Up to 7.5 MW reflected (30% of 25 MW). DIII-D: Up to 1.8 MW reflected (30% of 6 MW). Reflection coefficients typically 5-30% depending on plasma conditions and antenna tuning. Lower values (5-10%) indicate excellent coupling.

  Sign convention: Positive reflected power indicates power flow from plasma back to antenna system, with higher values indicating poorer coupling efficiency and potential system stress.
