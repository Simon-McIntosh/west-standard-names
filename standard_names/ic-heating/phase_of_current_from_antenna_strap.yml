name: phase_of_current_from_antenna_strap
description: Phase angle of current flowing through individual antenna strap.
documentation: Phase of the RF current in an individual antenna strap. Multiple straps
  in an antenna module are typically fed with controlled phase relationships to optimize
  the launched wave spectrum. The phase distribution determines the poloidal and toroidal
  mode numbers of the excited waves, controlling wave propagation direction and plasma
  heating location.
