description: Phase angle of forward RF power relative to first module in antenna array.
documentation: "Phase of the forward power signal measured at an antenna module, referenced\
  \ to the first module in the array. Phase differences between modules determine\
  \ the toroidal mode number $n_{\\phi}$ of the launched wave spectrum and control\
  \ the direction of wave propagation. Typical phasing schemes: monopole (0\xB0),\
  \ dipole (180\xB0), or traveling wave (90\xB0/270\xB0)."
