name: ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna_current_amplitude
description: Amplitude of current signal measured at ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: |-
  Amplitude of the RF current signal measured at the antenna module. Current distribution across antenna straps determines the launched wave spectrum. High currents (hundreds to thousands of amperes) can cause ohmic heating in antenna components and structural stresses.

  Governing equation:
  $$I_{antenna} = \frac{P_{forward}}{V_{antenna} \cos(\phi)}$$

  where $P_{forward}$ is forward power, $V_{antenna}$ is antenna voltage, and $\phi$ is the phase angle between voltage and current.

  Physical significance: This quantity directly affects [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) efficiency and [antenna_strap](#antenna_strap) performance. Current amplitude determines the electromagnetic field strength and wave coupling to plasma. Critical for [antenna_loading](#antenna_loading) analysis and [heating_system](#heating_system) protection. Strongly coupled to [antenna_voltage](#antenna_voltage), [plasma_impedance](#plasma_impedance), and [matching_network](#matching_network) performance. Essential for [wave_propagation](#wave_propagation) studies and [current_drive](#current_drive) efficiency calculations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Current_probes](#current_probes) measure RF current amplitudes with high accuracy (±2%). [Voltage_current_phase](#voltage_current_phase) measurements determine complex impedance. [Antenna_modeling](#antenna_modeling) calculations predict current distribution across straps. [Plasma_loading](#plasma_loading) analysis correlates current with coupling efficiency. Critical for [heating_system](#heating_system) optimization and [antenna_protection](#antenna_protection) algorithms.

  Typical values: ITER: 500-2000 A peak current per antenna module. JET: 300-1500 A depending on power level. DIII-D: 200-800 A typical operating range. Current densities 10-50 A/cm² in antenna straps. Higher currents enable greater heating capability but require careful thermal management.

  Sign convention: Positive current amplitude indicates forward power flow from amplifiers to antenna, with magnitude determining heating capability and system stress levels.
