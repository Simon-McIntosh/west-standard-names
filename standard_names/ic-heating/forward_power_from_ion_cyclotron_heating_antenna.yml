name: forward_power_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Forward RF power arriving at the back of an ion cyclotron heating antenna
  module.
documentation: Forward radio frequency power measured at the back of an individual
  antenna module, before entering the plasma-facing structures. This measurement is
  typically obtained from directional couplers in the transmission line. The difference
  between forward and reflected power gives the net power delivered to the plasma.
