name: phase_of_reflected_power_from_ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna
description: Phase angle of reflected RF power relative to forward power of the same
  module.
documentation: Phase of the reflected power signal relative to the forward power at
  the same antenna module. This phase information, combined with power measurements,
  allows calculation of complex impedance and standing wave ratio in the transmission
  line. Used for antenna matching network optimization.
