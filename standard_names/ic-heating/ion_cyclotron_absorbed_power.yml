description: Power absorbed by plasma ions from ion cyclotron heating systems.
documentation: |-
  Ion cyclotron absorbed power representing the power absorbed by plasma ions from ion cyclotron heating (ICH) systems in magnetized plasmas. This heating mechanism operates at frequencies matching ion cyclotron resonances and provides bulk ion heating through resonant wave-particle interactions. ICH is essential for achieving high ion temperatures and fusion conditions in tokamak operation, with absorption efficiency depending on ion species, magnetic field strength, and plasma parameters.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{absorbed} = P_{IC} \cdot \eta_{absorption} \cdot \eta_{coupling}$$

  where $P_{absorbed}$ is absorbed power, $P_{IC}$ is injected IC power, $\eta_{absorption}$ is absorption efficiency, and $\eta_{coupling}$ is coupling efficiency.

  Physical significance: Ion cyclotron absorbed power determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through ion heating and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for achieving high ion temperatures and fusion conditions in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through resonance conditions. Essential for [ion_cyclotron_heating](#ion_cyclotron_heating) and bulk plasma heating control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: ICH system monitors measure injected and reflected power for absorption analysis. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) profiles for heating efficiency validation. ICH modeling codes calculate absorption based on wave physics and plasma parameters. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines resonance locations. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: ICH absorbed power 20-40 MW at 25-55 MHz with absorption efficiency 60-80%. JET: 15-30 MW at 25-48 MHz with efficiency 50-75%. DIII-D: 8-20 MW at 30-65 MHz with efficiency 40-70%. Higher absorption at elevated [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) > 5 keV and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 8-40 MW depending on system capability.

  Sign convention: Positive absorbed power indicates energy transfer from IC waves to plasma ions through resonant absorption processes.
