name: reflectometry
description: Diagnostic technique measuring density profiles and fluctuations from
  reflected electromagnetic waves.
documentation: Reflectometry diagnostic measuring density profiles and fluctuations
  from reflected electromagnetic waves. Microwave or millimeter waves reflect at density
  cutoffs, providing profile and fluctuation measurements. Essential for edge plasma
  and core density profile measurements. Critical for turbulence studies and transport
  analysis. Provides high spatial and temporal resolution density data. Key diagnostic
  for edge physics and transport studies.
