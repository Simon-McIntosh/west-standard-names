description: Local electron density measurement from reflectometry diagnostic systems.
documentation: |-
  Reflectometer density measurement representing local electron density values obtained from microwave reflectometry systems in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique provides high-resolution, localized density measurements by analyzing wave reflection from density cutoff layers. The measurement is essential for plasma density profile reconstruction and equilibrium analysis in tokamak operation, offering excellent spatial and temporal resolution.

  Governing equation:
  $$n_e = \frac{\epsilon_0 m_e \omega^2}{e^2}$$

  where $n_e$ is electron density, $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is electron mass, $\omega$ is wave frequency, and $e$ is elementary charge.

  Physical significance: Reflectometer density measurement determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through localized density information and directly affects [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction. Critical for understanding [transport](#transport) physics and density profile evolution. Strongly coupled to [reflectometry](#reflectometry) systems, [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through equilibrium constraints. Essential for [equilibrium-reconstruction](#equilibrium-reconstruction) and profile analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Microwave reflectometry systems measure cutoff frequencies for density determination. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary density validation. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses reflectometer data for equilibrium constraints. [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) modeling codes calculate density from cutoff analysis. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Density measurements 1×10¹⁸ - 1×10²⁰ m⁻³ with spatial resolution 1-5 cm. JET: 5×10¹⁷ - 8×10¹⁹ m⁻³ with resolution 0.5-2 cm. DIII-D: 1×10¹⁸ - 5×10¹⁹ m⁻³ with high temporal resolution. Measurement precision typically 1-5% depending on plasma conditions. Range across machines: 10¹⁸-10²⁰ m⁻³.

  Sign convention: Positive density values represent physical electron density in the plasma, with measurements indicating local plasma conditions at specific radial positions.
