description: Phase measurement from reflectometry diagnostic for plasma density profiling.
documentation: |-
  Reflectometer phase representing the phase shift of electromagnetic waves reflected from density cutoff layers in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique uses microwave reflectometry to measure plasma density profiles by analyzing the phase difference between transmitted and reflected waves. The phase measurement provides high-resolution density profile information and is essential for understanding plasma equilibrium and transport in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\phi = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda} \int_0^{r_{cutoff}} \sqrt{n_e(r) - n_{cutoff}} \, dr$$

  where $\phi$ is the phase shift, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $n_e(r)$ is the electron density profile, and $n_{cutoff}$ is the cutoff density.

  Physical significance: Reflectometer phase determines [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles and directly affects [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through high-resolution density measurements. Strongly coupled to [reflectometry](#reflectometry) systems, [electron_density](#electron_density) gradients, and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through cutoff layer locations. Essential for [equilibrium-reconstruction](#equilibrium-reconstruction) and transport analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Microwave reflectometry systems measure phase shifts with high precision. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary density profile validation. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses reflectometer data for equilibrium constraints. [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) modeling codes calculate phase based on density profiles. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Phase measurements 0-4π radians for density profiles up to 1×10²⁰ m⁻³. JET: 0-3π radians for typical density ranges. DIII-D: 0-2π radians with high temporal resolution. Phase precision typically 0.01-0.1 radians depending on system configuration. Range across machines: 0-4π radians.

  Sign convention: Positive phase shift indicates increased path length due to plasma refraction, with larger shifts corresponding to higher density gradients.
