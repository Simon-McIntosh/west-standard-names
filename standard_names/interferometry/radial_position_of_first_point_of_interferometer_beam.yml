description: Major radius of the first point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the first geometric point defining
  an interferometer beam line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, φ). For non-reflected
  beams, the first point is typically the laser source location. For reflected beams
  (triple-point geometry), this point marks one end of the beam path. Accurate positioning
  is critical for calculating the geometric path length and interpreting line-integrated
  density measurements.
