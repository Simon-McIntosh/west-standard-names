name: interferometry
description: Diagnostic technique measuring electron density from phase shift of electromagnetic
  waves.
documentation: Interferometry diagnostic measuring electron density from phase shift
  of electromagnetic waves propagating through plasma. Laser or microwave beams experience
  phase shift proportional to line-integrated electron density. Essential for density
  measurements and equilibrium reconstruction. Multiple chords provide 2D density
  profiles through tomographic inversion. Critical for plasma control and performance
  monitoring. Provides fundamental density data for all plasma analysis.
