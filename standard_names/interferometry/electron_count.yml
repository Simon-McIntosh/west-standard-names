name: electron_count
description: Total number of electrons in the plasma volume.
documentation: 'Total number of electrons in the plasma, estimated from interferometer
  line-integrated density measurements. Calculated by integrating the reconstructed
  electron density over the plasma volume:


  $$N_e = \int n_e(\mathbf{r}) \, dV$$


  Typically obtained by combining multiple interferometer chords through tomographic
  inversion to reconstruct $n_e(\mathbf{r})$, followed by volumetric integration.
  For tokamak plasmas, typical values range from $10^{19}$ to $10^{21}$ electrons
  depending on machine size and density. This quantity is useful for particle balance
  studies, fueling efficiency analysis, and integrated modeling validation. Uncertainty
  depends on spatial coverage and inversion accuracy.'
