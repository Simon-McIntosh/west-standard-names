description: Wavelength of laser light used for interferometry measurement.
documentation: Wavelength of the laser beam used for interferometric density measurements.
  Common interferometer wavelengths include 10.6 μm (CO₂ lasers), 632.8 nm (HeNe lasers),
  and 1064 nm (Nd:YAG lasers). The wavelength determines the phase sensitivity to
  electron density through the dispersion relation. Multiple wavelengths may be used
  simultaneously (multi-chord or multi-color interferometry) to separate vibrational
  effects from plasma density changes or to resolve higher density plasmas.
