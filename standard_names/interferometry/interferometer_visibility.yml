description: Interference visibility from interferometer diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Interference visibility $V$ from interferometer diagnostic, representing the contrast of interference fringes due to plasma-induced beam attenuation and scattering. Visibility measurements provide information about plasma transparency and beam quality.

  $$V = \frac{I_{\max} - I_{\min}}{I_{\max} + I_{\min}}$$

  where $I_{\max}$ and $I_{\min}$ are maximum and minimum intensities in interference pattern.

  Physical significance:

  Interferometer visibility indicates plasma transparency and beam attenuation effects. Reduced visibility suggests increased beam scattering and absorption in plasma. Visibility measurements complement [interferometer_phase_shift](#interferometer_phase_shift) with information about beam-plasma interactions. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density effects and [beam_attenuation](#beam_attenuation) for absorption processes.

  Measurement relation:

  Visibility relates to beam intensity and plasma attenuation:

  $$V = V_0 \exp(-\alpha \int n_e \, dl)$$

  where $V_0$ is vacuum visibility, $\alpha$ is attenuation coefficient, and $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density).

  Measurement methods:

  Interferometer visibility is measured from interference fringe contrast analysis. Beam intensity profiles are recorded with and without plasma. Multiple wavelengths provide information about wavelength-dependent effects. Visibility analysis includes both amplitude and phase information. Calibration uses vacuum measurements and known attenuation references.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected visibility values of 0.8-1.0 for low-density plasmas, decreasing to 0.1-0.5 for high-density operations. JET: Typical visibility 0.9-1.0 for standard operations, decreasing to 0.3-0.7 for high-density cases. DIII-D: Visibility ranges 0.95-1.0 for typical discharges, down to 0.5-0.8 for high-density conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.01.

  Sign convention: Positive visibility indicates beam transmission quality, with values from 0 (no interference) to 1 (perfect interference).
