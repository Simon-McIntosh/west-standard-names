name: measured_faraday_rotation_angle
description: Measured Faraday rotation angle used in equilibrium reconstruction.
documentation: 'Faraday rotation angle $\theta_F$ of polarized electromagnetic wave
  measured by polarimetry diagnostic. Rotation is proportional to line-integrated
  parallel magnetic field and electron density: $\theta_F = \frac{e^3 \lambda^2}{8\pi^2
  \epsilon_0 m_e^2 c^2} \int n_e B_{\parallel} dl$. Provides constraint on poloidal
  field and current profile in reconstruction.'
