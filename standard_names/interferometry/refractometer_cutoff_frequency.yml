description: Cutoff frequency for electromagnetic wave propagation.
documentation: |-
  Cutoff frequency $f_c$ for electromagnetic wave propagation in plasma, representing the frequency below which waves are reflected due to plasma density. Refractometry uses cutoff measurements to determine local [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles.

  $$f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{n_e e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}}$$

  where $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $e$ is electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity, and $m_e$ is electron mass.

  Physical significance:

  Cutoff frequencies determine the propagation limits of electromagnetic waves in plasma. Refractometer measurements provide local [electron_density](#electron_density) measurements without line integration. Cutoff analysis enables density profile reconstruction with high spatial resolution. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [reflectometry](#reflectometry) for wave propagation.

  Measurement relation:

  Cutoff frequency relates directly to electron density:

  $$f_c = 8.98 \times 10^3 \sqrt{n_e}$$

  for $f_c$ in Hz and $n_e$ in m$^{-3}$.

  Measurement methods:

  Refractometer systems sweep microwave frequencies through plasma and detect cutoff reflections. Time-of-flight measurements give density profile information. Frequency scanning provides high spatial resolution density profiles. Multiple frequencies improve measurement accuracy and coverage. Calibration uses known density references and frequency standards.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected cutoff frequencies of 50-200 GHz for core plasma densities (10^20 m^-3), edge frequencies 10-50 GHz. JET: Typical frequencies 25-100 GHz for high-density operations. DIII-D: Frequency ranges 10-75 GHz depending on plasma density. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of frequency.

  Sign convention: Positive frequency indicates higher electron density.
