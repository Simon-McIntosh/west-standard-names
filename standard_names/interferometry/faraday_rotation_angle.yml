description: Faraday rotation angle of polarized electromagnetic wave through plasma.
documentation: |-
  Faraday rotation angle $\theta_F$ of polarized electromagnetic wave propagating through magnetized plasma. The rotation is proportional to line-integrated parallel magnetic field and electron density:

  $$\theta_F = \frac{e^3 \lambda^2}{8\pi^2 \epsilon_0 m_e^2 c^2} \int n_e B_{\parallel} dl$$

  where $e$ is elementary charge, $\lambda$ is wavelength, $n_e$ is electron density, and $B_{\parallel}$ is the magnetic field component parallel to the beam.

  This quantity can be directly measured by polarimetry diagnostics or calculated from equilibrium reconstructions. When measured, it provides a constraint on poloidal field and current profile in reconstruction. When reconstructed, comparison with measured values assesses equilibrium solution quality and poloidal field accuracy.
