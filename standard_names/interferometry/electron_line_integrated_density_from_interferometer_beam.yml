description: Line-integrated electron density measured by interferometer along beam
  path.
documentation: "Line-integrated electron number density measured along the interferometer\
  \ beam path, defined as:\n\n$$n_e^{line} = \\int n_e(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dl$$\n\nwhere\
  \ the integral is taken along the line of sight and $n_e(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local\
  \ electron density. Obtained from the measured phase shift using the conversion\
  \ factor. For reflected beams (retroreflector geometry), this represents the integral\
  \ over the full path (forward AND return), not divided by 2. Typical values range\
  \ from $10^{18}$ to $10^{21}$ m\u207B\xB2 depending on plasma density and chord\
  \ length. Multiple chords can be inverted tomographically to reconstruct radial\
  \ density profiles."
