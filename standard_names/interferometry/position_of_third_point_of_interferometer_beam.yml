description: Position vector of the third point defining reflected interferometer
  line of sight.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, φ) of the third geometric\
  \ point defining a reflected interferometer beam line of sight. Used only for retroreflector-based\
  \ systems where the beam traverses the plasma twice (forward and return paths).\
  \ Components are:\n- radial_position_of_third_point_of_interferometer_beam\n- vertical_position_of_third_point_of_interferometer_beam\
  \  \n- toroidal_angle_of_third_point_of_interferometer_beam\n\nThis vector represents\
  \ the final detector location after beam reflection."
