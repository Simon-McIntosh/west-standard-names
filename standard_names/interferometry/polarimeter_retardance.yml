description: Retardance measurement from polarimeter diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Retardance $\delta$ measurement from polarimeter diagnostic, representing the phase difference between orthogonal polarization components due to plasma birefringence. Retardance measurements provide information about plasma optical properties and magnetic field effects.

  $$\delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \int \Delta n \, dl$$

  where $\Delta n$ is the difference in refractive indices for orthogonal polarizations and $dl$ is path length element.

  Physical significance:

  Polarimeter retardance measures the birefringence of magnetized plasma, providing information about [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) orientation and strength. Retardance is sensitive to both [faraday_rotation_angle](#faraday_rotation_angle) and Cotton-Mouton effects. Polarimeter measurements complement interferometry with polarization analysis. See [polarimetry](#polarimetry) for polarization concepts and [birefringence](#birefringence) for optical properties.

  Measurement relation:

  Retardance relates to plasma birefringence and magnetic field:

  $$\delta = \delta_F + \delta_{CM}$$

  where $\delta_F$ is Faraday retardance and $\delta_{CM}$ is Cotton-Mouton retardance.

  Measurement methods:

  Polarimeter retardance is measured using polarization modulation and phase-sensitive detection. Multiple polarization states are analyzed to determine retardance. High-speed modulators enable rapid measurement. Multiple wavelengths improve accuracy and field sensitivity. Calibration uses known retarders and reference measurements.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected retardance values of 0.1-1 radian for typical magnetized plasmas, depending on density and field strength. JET: Typical retardance 0.01-0.1 radian for standard operations. DIII-D: Retardance ranges 0.001-0.01 radian depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.001 radians.

  Sign convention: Positive retardance indicates phase delay of one polarization component relative to the orthogonal component, following standard polarimetry conventions and optical physics.
