description: Phase shift measured by interferometer, corrected for fringe jumps.
documentation: "Interferometric phase shift measured by the diagnostic system, with\
  \ 2\u03C0 fringe-jump corrections applied. The phase shift is related to line-integrated\
  \ electron density through the dispersion relation:\n\n$$\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{r_e\
  \ \\lambda}{2} \\int n_e \\, dl$$\n\nwhere $r_e = 2.818 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is the\
  \ classical electron radius, $\\lambda$ is the laser wavelength, and the integral\
  \ is along the beam path. Fringe jump correction algorithms unwrap the phase to\
  \ provide continuous measurements through density transients. Raw phase data may\
  \ contain discontinuities; this corrected version should be continuous and monotonic\
  \ during plasma buildup."
