documentation: Polarimetry diagnostic measuring magnetic field and current from Faraday
  rotation and Cotton-Mouton effects. Polarized electromagnetic waves experience rotation
  and elliptical birefringence in magnetized plasma. Essential for measuring poloidal
  magnetic field and current profiles. Critical for equilibrium reconstruction and
  current profile determination. Provides complementary information to magnetic diagnostics.
  Key diagnostic for tokamak equilibrium analysis and control.
