description: Toroidal angle of the first point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: Toroidal angle coordinate (φ) of the first geometric point defining
  an interferometer beam line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, φ). The angle
  is measured counter-clockwise when viewing from above, following standard tokamak
  conventions. This coordinate, together with R and Z, fully specifies the spatial
  location of the beam endpoint or source position.
