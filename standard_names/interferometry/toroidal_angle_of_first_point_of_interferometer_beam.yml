description: Toroidal angle of the first point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: "Toroidal angle coordinate (\u03C6) of the first geometric point defining\
  \ an interferometer beam line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, \u03C6\
  ). The angle is measured counter-clockwise when viewing from above, following standard\
  \ tokamak conventions. This coordinate, together with R and Z, fully specifies the\
  \ spatial location of the beam endpoint or source position."
