name: toroidal_angle_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam
description: Toroidal angle of the second point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: Toroidal angle coordinate (φ) of the second geometric point defining
  an interferometer beam line of sight. Measured counter-clockwise when viewing from
  above. Together with the corresponding R and Z coordinates, this defines the second
  spatial endpoint of the measurement chord.
