description: Group delay measurement from refractometer diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Group delay $\tau_g$ measurement from refractometer diagnostic, representing the time delay of microwave pulses due to plasma refractive index. Group delay measurements provide high-resolution [electron_density](#electron_density) profile information.

  $$\tau_g = \frac{1}{c} \int \frac{d}{df} (n f) \, dl = \frac{1}{c} \int \left( n + f \frac{dn}{df} \right) \, dl$$

  where $n$ is refractive index, $f$ is frequency, and $c$ is speed of light.

  Physical significance:

  Refractometer group delay provides high-resolution local [electron_density](#electron_density) measurements without line integration. Time-of-flight analysis gives density profile information with excellent spatial resolution. Group delay complement [refractometer_cutoff_frequency](#refractometer_cutoff_frequency) measurements with continuous profile coverage. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [wave_propagation](#wave_propagation) for propagation effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Group delay relates to electron density and wave dispersion:

  $$\tau_g = \frac{1}{c} \int \sqrt{1 - \frac{f_p^2}{f^2}} \, dl$$

  where $f_p$ is plasma frequency proportional to $\sqrt{n_e}$.

  Measurement methods:

  Refractometer group delay uses microwave pulse transmission with precise timing measurements. Pulse propagation times are measured with high accuracy. Frequency scanning provides continuous density profile coverage. Multiple frequencies improve spatial resolution and accuracy. Calibration uses known density references and timing standards.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected group delays of 0.1-1 μs for typical plasma densities, depending on chord length and density gradients. JET: Typical delays 0.01-0.1 μs for standard operations. DIII-D: Delay ranges 0.001-0.01 μs depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 1 ns.

  Sign convention: Positive group delay indicates slower wave propagation due to increased plasma density, following standard wave propagation physics and electromagnetic theory.
