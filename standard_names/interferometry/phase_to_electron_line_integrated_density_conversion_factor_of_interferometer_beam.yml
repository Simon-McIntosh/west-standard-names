description: Conversion factor from measured phase to line-integrated electron density.
documentation: "Calibration factor converting interferometric phase measurements (in\
  \ radians) to line-integrated electron density (in m\u207B\xB2). Derived from the\
  \ dispersion relation for electromagnetic wave propagation through plasma:\n\n$$n_e^{line}\
  \ = C \\cdot \\Delta \\phi$$\n\nwhere $C = \\frac{2}{r_e \\lambda}$ is this conversion\
  \ factor, $r_e = 2.818 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is the classical electron radius, and\
  \ $\\lambda$ is the wavelength. For example, at \u03BB = 10.6 \u03BCm (CO\u2082\
  \ laser), $C \\approx 6.7 \\times 10^{19}$ m\u207B\xB2 rad\u207B\xB9. This factor\
  \ is wavelength-specific and must be applied separately for each interferometer\
  \ channel or wavelength."
