description: Conversion factor from measured phase to line-integrated electron density.
documentation: |-
  Calibration factor converting interferometric phase measurements (in radians) to line-integrated electron density (in m⁻²). Derived from the dispersion relation for electromagnetic wave propagation through plasma:

  $$n_e^{line} = C \cdot \Delta \phi$$


  where $C = \frac{2}{r_e \lambda}$ is this conversion factor, $r_e = 2.818 \times 10^{-15}$ m is the classical electron radius, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. For example, at λ = 10.6 μm (CO₂ laser), $C \approx 6.7 \times 10^{19}$ m⁻² rad⁻¹. This factor is wavelength-specific and must be applied separately for each interferometer channel or wavelength.


  Governing equation:
  $$C = \frac{2}{r_e \lambda} = \frac{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2}{e^2 \lambda} = \frac{4.49 \times 10^{-14}}{\lambda}$$


  where $e$ is electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity of free space, $m_e$ is electron mass, $c$ is speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the laser wavelength in meters.

  Typical values: CO₂ laser (10.6 μm): $C \approx 6.7 \times 10^{19}$ m⁻² rad⁻¹. HeNe laser (632.8 nm): $C \approx 1.1 \times 10^{21}$ m⁻² rad⁻¹. Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm): $C \approx 6.3 \times 10^{20}$ m⁻² rad⁻¹. Conversion factors scale inversely with wavelength.


  Sign convention: Positive conversion factor indicates direct proportionality between phase shift and line-integrated density, with magnitude determined by laser wavelength and fundamental physical constants.
