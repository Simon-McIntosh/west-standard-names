description: Major radius of the second point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the second geometric point defining
  an interferometer beam line of sight. For non-reflected beams (two-point geometry),
  this is the detector location opposite the source. For reflected beams (three-point
  geometry), this is the intermediate reflection point (e.g., retroreflector position).
  The line connecting first and second points defines the beam path used for line-integrated
  density measurements.
