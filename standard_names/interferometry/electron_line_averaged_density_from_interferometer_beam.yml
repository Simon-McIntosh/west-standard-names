description: Line-averaged electron density obtained by dividing line integral by
  path length.
documentation: "Line-averaged electron number density obtained by dividing the line-integrated\
  \ density by the geometric path length:\n\n$$\\bar{n}_e = \\frac{1}{L} \\int n_e(\\\
  mathbf{r}) \\, dl$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the total path length along the line of sight.\
  \ For reflected beams, $L$ includes both forward and return paths. This quantity\
  \ provides a simple density estimate representative of the plasma along the measurement\
  \ chord. Typical tokamak values: $10^{18}$ - $10^{20}$ m\u207B\xB3. Note that this\
  \ is a chord-averaged quantity; central density is typically higher than line-averaged\
  \ values due to peaked density profiles."
