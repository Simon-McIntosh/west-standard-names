description: Wavefront distortion measurement from optical diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Wavefront distortion $W$ measurement from optical diagnostic, representing the deformation of electromagnetic wavefronts due to plasma refractive index gradients. Wavefront analysis provides detailed information about plasma density gradients and turbulence.

  $$W = \int \Delta n(x,y) \, dl$$

  where $\Delta n$ is refractive index variation and $dl$ is path length element.

  Physical significance:

  Wavefront distortion measures the cumulative effect of plasma refractive index gradients on beam propagation. Distortion analysis provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) fluctuations and [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) processes. Wavefront measurements complement other optical diagnostics with high spatial resolution. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density effects and [turbulence](#turbulence) for fluctuation analysis.

  Measurement relation:

  Wavefront distortion relates to density gradients:

  $$\nabla W = \nabla \int \Delta n \, dl$$

  where $\nabla W$ is wavefront tilt and $\Delta n$ is density-induced index change.

  Measurement methods:

  Wavefront distortion is measured using Shack-Hartmann sensors or interferometric techniques. Beam wavefronts are analyzed for local tilt and curvature. Multiple beams provide 2D distortion mapping. High-speed cameras enable turbulence studies. Calibration uses known phase plates and reference beams.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected wavefront distortion of 0.1-1 radian for typical plasma operations, depending on density gradients. JET: Typical distortion 0.01-0.1 radian for standard operations. DIII-D: Distortion ranges 0.001-0.01 radian depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.001 radians.

  Sign convention: Positive distortion indicates wavefront deformation in the direction of increasing refractive index, following standard optics conventions and wave propagation physics.
