description: Optical path length variation due to plasma refractive index changes.
documentation: |-
  Optical path length variation caused by plasma-induced changes in the refractive index along the interferometer beam path. Related to the phase shift by:

  $$\Delta L = \frac{\lambda \Delta \phi}{2\pi}$$


  where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\Delta \phi$ is the measured phase shift. This quantity represents the effective physical path length change due to the plasma's dispersive properties. For typical tokamak plasmas with $n_e \sim 10^{19}$ m⁻³, path length variations are on the order of micrometers to millimeters depending on wavelength and chord geometry.


  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta L = \int_0^L [n_{plasma}(s) - n_{vacuum}] \, ds = \int_0^L \Delta n(s) \, ds$$


  where $n_{plasma}$ is the plasma refractive index, $n_{vacuum} = 1$ is the vacuum refractive index, and $\Delta n$ is the refractive index change.


  Physical significance: This quantity directly measures [optical_path_length](#optical_path_length) changes due to [plasma_refractivity](#plasma_refractivity) effects, providing information about [electron_density](#electron_density) distribution and [plasma_optics](#plasma_optics) properties. Critical for [interferometry](#interferometry) calibration and [beam_propagation](#beam_propagation) analysis. Strongly coupled to [phase_shift](#phase_shift), [refractive_index](#refractive_index), and [plasma_density](#plasma_density) through dispersion relations. Essential for [optical_diagnostics](#optical_diagnostics) and [plasma_monitoring](#plasma_monitoring) in tokamak operation.


  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Interferometric_measurements](#interferometric_measurements) determine path length variations from phase shift analysis. [Optical_path_tracking](#optical_path_tracking) systems monitor beam propagation changes. [Refractive_index_calculations](#refractive_index_calculations) relate density to optical path length. [Beam_modeling](#beam_modeling) codes predict path length effects. [Calibration_procedures](#calibration_procedures) ensure accurate path length determination.


  Typical values: ITER: Expected path length variations 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻³ m depending on plasma density and beam wavelength. JET: Typical variations 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁴ m for standard operations. DIII-D: Path length ranges 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁵ m depending on plasma conditions. Higher densities and longer wavelengths produce larger path length changes.


  Sign convention: Positive path length variation indicates increased optical path due to plasma refractive index, with magnitude determined by plasma density and beam wavelength.
