name: reconstructed_faraday_rotation_angle
description: Reconstructed Faraday angle from equilibrium solution along diagnostic
  chord.
documentation: Faraday rotation angle $\theta_F$ calculated from reconstructed equilibrium
  by integrating magnetic field and density along polarimetry chord. Comparison with
  measured value assesses equilibrium reconstruction quality and poloidal field accuracy.
