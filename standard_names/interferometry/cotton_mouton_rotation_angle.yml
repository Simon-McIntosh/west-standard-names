description: Cotton-Mouton rotation angle measurement.
documentation: |-
  Cotton-Mouton rotation angle $\theta_{CM}$ measurement, representing the rotation of polarization plane due to birefringence in magnetized plasma. Cotton-Mouton effect provides information about [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) perpendicular to wave propagation.

  $$\theta_{CM} = \frac{e^4}{8\pi^3 \epsilon_0^2 m_e^2 c^3} \frac{1}{\lambda^3} \int n_e B_{\perp}^2 \, dl$$

  where $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $B_{\perp}$ is perpendicular [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field), and $dl$ is path length element.

  Physical significance:

  Cotton-Mouton rotation measures the birefringence of magnetized plasma, providing information about perpendicular [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) components. The effect is quadratic in magnetic field strength, making it sensitive to high-field regions. Cotton-Mouton polarimetry complements [faraday_rotation_angle](#faraday_rotation_angle) measurements with different field sensitivity. See [polarimetry](#polarimetry) for polarization analysis and [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field relationships.

  Measurement relation:

  Cotton-Mouton rotation relates to electron density and perpendicular magnetic field:

  $$\theta_{CM} = 1.16 \times 10^{-8} \frac{1}{\lambda^3} \int n_e B_{\perp}^2 \, dl$$

  for $\lambda$ in meters, $n_e$ in m$^{-3}$, and $B_{\perp}$ in Tesla.

  Measurement methods:

  Cotton-Mouton rotation measurements use polarized laser beams with high-sensitivity polarimetry. Rotation angle is measured using interferometric techniques with phase-sensitive detection. Multiple wavelengths improve measurement accuracy and field sensitivity. Path alignment minimizes beam steering effects. Calibration uses known magnetic fields and reference measurements.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected rotation angles of 0.001-0.01 radian for typical magnetized plasmas, depending on density and field strength. JET: Typical angles 0.0001-0.001 radian for standard operations. DIII-D: Rotation ranges 0.00001-0.0001 radian depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 10^-6 radians.

  Sign convention: Positive rotation follows standard optics conventions for birefringent media, with rotation direction determined by the sign of perpendicular magnetic field.
