description: Phase shift measured by interferometer, corrected for fringe jumps.
documentation: |-
  Interferometric phase shift measured by the diagnostic system, with 2π fringe-jump corrections applied. The phase shift is related to line-integrated electron density through the dispersion relation:

  $$\Delta \phi = \frac{r_e \lambda}{2} \int n_e \, dl$$


  where $r_e = 2.818 \times 10^{-15}$ m is the classical electron radius, $\lambda$ is the laser wavelength, and the integral is along the beam path. Fringe jump correction algorithms unwrap the phase to provide continuous measurements through density transients. Raw phase data may contain discontinuities; this corrected version should be continuous and monotonic during plasma buildup.


  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta \phi = \frac{e^2}{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2} \lambda \int n_e(s) \, ds = 2.36 \times 10^{-15} \lambda \int n_e(s) \, ds$$


  where $e$ is electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity of free space, $m_e$ is electron mass, $c$ is speed of light, and $n_e(s)$ is electron density along the beam path.


  Physical significance: This quantity provides direct measurement of [line_integrated_density](#line_integrated_density) for [plasma_density](#plasma_density) profile reconstruction and [density_control](#density_control) applications. Phase measurements are essential for [equilibrium_validation](#equilibrium_validation) and [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation). Critical for [interferometry](#interferometry) diagnostics and [plasma_monitoring](#plasma_monitoring). Strongly coupled to [electron_density](#electron_density), [refractive_index](#refractive_index), and [beam_propagation](#beam_propagation) through plasma dispersion relations. Essential for [density_feedback](#density_feedback) control systems and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) assessment.


  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Interferometric_systems](#interferometric_systems) measure phase differences between reference and probe beams. [Fringe_tracking](#fringe_tracking) algorithms unwrap phase measurements to remove discontinuities. [Phase_detection](#phase_detection) systems provide high-precision phase measurements. [Density_inversion](#density_inversion) techniques reconstruct local density from line-integrated measurements. [Real_time_processing](#real_time_processing) enables continuous plasma monitoring.


  Typical values: ITER: Expected phase shifts 1-10 radians for typical plasma densities and chord lengths. JET: Typical phase shifts 0.1-1 radian for standard operations. DIII-D: Phase ranges 0.01-0.1 radian depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.001 radians for calibrated systems.


  Sign convention: Positive phase shift indicates increased refractive index due to higher electron density, following standard interferometry conventions and optical physics principles.
