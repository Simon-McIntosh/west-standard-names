description: Optical path length variation due to plasma refractive index changes.
documentation: "Optical path length variation caused by plasma-induced changes in\
  \ the refractive index along the interferometer beam path. Related to the phase\
  \ shift by:\n\n$$\\Delta L = \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta \\phi}{2\\pi}$$\n\nwhere $\\\
  lambda$ is the wavelength and $\\Delta \\phi$ is the measured phase shift. This\
  \ quantity represents the effective physical path length change due to the plasma's\
  \ dispersive properties. For typical tokamak plasmas with $n_e \\sim 10^{19}$ m\u207B\
  \xB3, path length variations are on the order of micrometers to millimeters depending\
  \ on wavelength and chord geometry."
