description: Line-averaged electron density obtained by dividing line integral by
  path length.
documentation: |-
  Line-averaged electron number density obtained by dividing the line-integrated density by the geometric path length:

  $$\bar{n}_e = \frac{1}{L} \int n_e(\mathbf{r}) \, dl$$

  where $L$ is the total path length along the line of sight. For reflected beams, $L$ includes both forward and return paths. This quantity provides a simple density estimate representative of the plasma along the measurement chord. Typical tokamak values: $10^{18}$ - $10^{20}$ m⁻³. Note that this is a chord-averaged quantity; central density is typically higher than line-averaged values due to peaked density profiles.
