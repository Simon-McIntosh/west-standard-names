description: Volume-averaged electron density estimated from multiple interferometer
  chords.
documentation: |-
  Volume-averaged electron number density estimated from multiple interferometer line-integrated measurements. Computed by combining data from multiple chords with different spatial coverage, typically using Abel inversion or tomographic reconstruction followed by volumetric integration:

  $$\langle n_e \rangle_V = \frac{1}{V} \int n_e(\mathbf{r}) \, dV$$

  where $V$ is the plasma volume. This global quantity is used for plasma inventory calculations, performance assessment, and comparison with other volume-averaged measurements (e.g., from diamagnetic loops). Uncertainty increases with fewer chords and non-uniform spatial coverage.
