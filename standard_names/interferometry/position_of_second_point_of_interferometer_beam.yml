description: Position vector of the second point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, \u03C6) of the second geometric\
  \ point defining an interferometer beam line of sight. For non-reflected beams,\
  \ this is the detector location. For reflected beams, this is the retroreflector\
  \ position. Components are:\n- radial_position_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam\n\
  - vertical_position_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam\n- toroidal_angle_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam\n\
  \nThe line segment connecting first and second position vectors defines the primary\
  \ beam path through the plasma."
