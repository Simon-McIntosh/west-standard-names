description: Position vector of the second point defining interferometer line of sight.
documentation: |-
  Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, φ) of the second geometric point defining an interferometer beam line of sight. For non-reflected beams, this is the detector location. For reflected beams, this is the retroreflector position. Components are:
  - radial_position_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam
  - vertical_position_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam
  - toroidal_angle_of_second_point_of_interferometer_beam

  The line segment connecting first and second position vectors defines the primary beam path through the plasma.
