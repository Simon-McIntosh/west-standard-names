description: Line-integrated electron density measured by interferometer along beam
  path.
documentation: |-
  Line-integrated electron number density measured along the interferometer beam path, defined as:

  $$n_e^{line} = \int n_e(\mathbf{r}) \, dl$$

  where the integral is taken along the line of sight and $n_e(\mathbf{r})$ is the local electron density. Obtained from the measured phase shift using the conversion factor. For reflected beams (retroreflector geometry), this represents the integral over the full path (forward AND return), not divided by 2. Typical values range from $10^{18}$ to $10^{21}$ m⁻² depending on plasma density and chord length. Multiple chords can be inverted tomographically to reconstruct radial density profiles.
