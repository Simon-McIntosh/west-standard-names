description: Major radius of the third point defining reflected interferometer line
  of sight.
documentation: 'Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the third geometric point defining
  a reflected interferometer beam line of sight. This point is only used for reflected
  beam configurations (retroreflector-based systems) where the beam traverses the
  plasma twice. The third point typically represents the final detector location after
  reflection at the second point. The complete path is: first point → second point
  (reflection) → third point.'
