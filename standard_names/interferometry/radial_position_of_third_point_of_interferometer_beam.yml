description: Major radius of the third point defining reflected interferometer line
  of sight.
documentation: "Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the third geometric point defining\
  \ a reflected interferometer beam line of sight. This point is only used for reflected\
  \ beam configurations (retroreflector-based systems) where the beam traverses the\
  \ plasma twice. The third point typically represents the final detector location\
  \ after reflection at the second point. The complete path is: first point \u2192\
  \ second point (reflection) \u2192 third point."
