description: Line-integrated electron density measurement from interferometry diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Interferometer line-integrated density representing the line integral of electron density along interferometer beam paths in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique measures phase shifts of electromagnetic waves passing through the plasma, providing line-averaged density measurements along multiple chords. Interferometry is essential for density control and equilibrium reconstruction in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta\phi = \frac{e^2}{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c} \int_0^L n_e(l) \, dl$$

  where $\Delta\phi$ is phase shift, $e$ is elementary charge, $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is electron mass, $c$ is speed of light, $n_e(l)$ is electron density along the path, and $L$ is path length.

  Physical significance: Interferometer line-integrated density determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through density monitoring and directly affects [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction. Critical for understanding [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles and density control in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [interferometry](#interferometry) systems, [electron_density](#electron_density), and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through chord analysis. Essential for [equilibrium-reconstruction](#equilibrium-reconstruction) and density control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Interferometry systems measure phase shifts with high precision. [Interferometry](#interferometry) analysis converts phase shifts to line-integrated densities. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses interferometer data for equilibrium constraints. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary density validation. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Line-integrated density 1×10²⁰ - 5×10²¹ m⁻² with multiple chord configurations. JET: 5×10¹⁹ - 3×10²¹ m⁻² for various plasma conditions. DIII-D: 1×10¹⁹ - 2×10²¹ m⁻² with high temporal resolution. Phase precision typically 0.01-0.1 radians. Range across machines: 10¹⁹-5×10²¹ m⁻².

  Sign convention: Positive when phase shifts indicate increased electron density along the measurement chord, with larger shifts corresponding to higher line-integrated densities.
