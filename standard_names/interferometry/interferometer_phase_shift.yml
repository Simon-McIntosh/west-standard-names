description: Phase shift measurement from interferometer diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Phase shift $\Delta \phi$ measurement from interferometer diagnostic, representing the phase difference between reference and probe beams due to plasma refractive index changes. Interferometry measures line-integrated [electron_density](#electron_density) through plasma-induced beam deflection.

  $$\Delta \phi = \frac{e^2}{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c} \lambda \int n_e \, dl$$

  where $e$ is electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity, $m_e$ is electron mass, $c$ is speed of light, $\lambda$ is wavelength, $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), and $dl$ is path length element.

  Physical significance:

  Interferometer phase shift provides direct measurement of line-integrated [electron_density](#electron_density) for plasma density profile reconstruction. Phase measurements are essential for density control and equilibrium validation. Interferometry complement [thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measurements with continuous monitoring. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [refractive_index](#refractive_index) for optical properties.

  Measurement relation:

  Phase shift relates directly to electron density:

  $$\Delta \phi = 2.36 \times 10^{-15} \lambda \int n_e \, dl$$

  for $\lambda$ in meters and $n_e$ in m$^{-3}$.

  Measurement methods:

  Interferometer systems split laser beams into reference and probe paths. Phase comparison gives interference pattern changes. Multiple chords provide 2D density reconstruction. Beam paths are carefully aligned to minimize refraction effects. Calibration uses known density targets and path length measurements.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected phase shifts of 1-10 radians for typical plasma densities, depending on chord length and density. JET: Typical phase shifts 0.1-1 radian for standard operations. DIII-D: Phase ranges 0.01-0.1 radian depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.01 radians.

  Sign convention: Positive phase shift indicates increased refractive index (higher electron density), following standard interferometry conventions and optical physics principles.
