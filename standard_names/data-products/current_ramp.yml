description: Phase of tokamak operation where plasma current is increased to target
  value.
documentation: Current ramp phase where plasma current is increased from breakdown
  to target value. Governed by transformer action and current diffusion. Ramp rate
  affects skin current formation, MHD stability, and confinement. Optimal ramp rates
  balance fast current penetration with stability requirements. Critical phase for
  avoiding disruptions and achieving target performance. Current ramp scenarios optimized
  for each tokamak and plasma configuration.
