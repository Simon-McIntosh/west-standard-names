description: Tokamak operational regimes and scenarios for plasma performance.
documentation: Tokamak operational regimes including Ohmic, L-mode, H-mode, and advanced
  scenarios. Each regime characterized by confinement properties, stability limits,
  and performance metrics. H-mode provides improved confinement with edge pedestal.
  Advanced scenarios include hybrid, steady-state, and high-beta operations. Operational
  parameters include plasma current, heating power, density, and magnetic field. Essential
  for scenario planning and performance optimization.
