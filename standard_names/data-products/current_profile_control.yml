description: Control systems and techniques for modifying plasma current profiles.
documentation: |-
  Current profile control systems and techniques including electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD), lower hybrid current drive (LHCD), and neutral beam modulation used to modify $q$-profiles and improve MHD stability and confinement. This comprehensive approach to current profile optimization is essential for achieving advanced tokamak scenarios with reversed magnetic shear and improved confinement properties.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{\partial j(r,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} \left[ \eta(r) \frac{\partial j(r,t)}{\partial r} \right] + S_{drive}(r,t)$$

  where $j(r,t)$ is current density, $\eta(r)$ is resistivity, and $S_{drive}(r,t)$ represents external current drive sources.

  Physical significance: Current profile control determines [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through $q$-profile shaping and directly affects [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) in tokamak operation. Optimized profiles enable [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation) with reduced auxiliary power requirements. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and disruption avoidance. Strongly coupled to [safety_factor](#safety_factor), [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current), and [current_drive](#current_drive) efficiency. Essential for advanced operating modes with improved confinement.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines $q$-profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures kinetic profiles for profile control optimization. Real-time control systems adjust power deposition to achieve target profiles. [Motional_Stark_effect](#Motional_Stark_effect) provides direct current density measurements for feedback control.

  Typical values: ITER: Control systems maintaining $q_{min} > 1.5$ and $q_{95} = 3.0-3.5$ for stable operation. JET: $q$-profile control achieving reversed shear scenarios. DIII-D: Advanced profile control enabling high performance hybrid scenarios. Control response times 100-1000 ms for profile evolution.

  Sign convention: Positive current density follows standard plasma current direction, with profile shapes optimized for stability and performance.
