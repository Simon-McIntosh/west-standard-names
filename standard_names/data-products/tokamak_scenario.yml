description: Specific operational scenario for tokamak plasma performance optimization.
documentation: 'Tokamak scenario defining specific operational parameters for optimized
  plasma performance. Includes plasma current, heating power, density, magnetic field,
  and control settings. Scenarios optimized for different objectives: maximum fusion
  power, steady-state operation, high beta, or stability. Examples: H-mode scenario,
  hybrid scenario, steady-state scenario. Each scenario has specific operational windows
  and performance characteristics. Essential for experimental planning and predictive
  modeling.'
