description: Steady-state tokamak operation with non-inductive current drive.
documentation: Steady-state operation achieving continuous tokamak plasma without
  transformer action. Requires non-inductive current drive providing 100% of plasma
  current. Bootstrap current provides 50-80%, external drive (ECCD, LHCD, NBCD) provides
  remainder. Enables continuous operation without current ramp constraints. Essential
  for ITER and future tokamaks. Requires advanced scenarios with optimized current
  profiles and high bootstrap fraction.
