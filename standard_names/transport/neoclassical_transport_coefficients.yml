description: Transport coefficients from neoclassical theory including diffusion and
  viscosity.
documentation: |-
  Neoclassical transport coefficients describing particle and energy transport in toroidal plasmas arising from Coulomb collisions and magnetic geometry effects. These coefficients include diffusion (D), thermal diffusivity (χ), and viscosity (η) components that depend on collisionality, magnetic geometry, and plasma parameters. The theory accounts for banana, plateau, and Pfirsch-Schluter transport regimes determined by particle collision frequency relative to orbital frequencies. Essential for predicting transport barriers, bootstrap current generation, and confinement scaling in tokamak plasmas.

  Governing equations:
  $$D_{neo} = D_{banana} + D_{plateau} + D_{PS}$$

  $$\chi_{neo,i/e} = \chi_{banana,i/e} + \chi_{plateau,i/e} + \chi_{PS,i/e}$$

  where $D_{banana}$, $D_{plateau}$, and $D_{PS}$ are transport coefficients in banana, plateau, and Pfirsch-Schluter regimes respectively, and $\chi_{neo,i/e}$ are ion/electron thermal diffusivities.

  Physical significance: These coefficients determine [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) and directly affect [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through transport losses. Critical for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Strongly dependent on [collisionality](#collisionality), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [safety_factor](#safety_factor). Essential for predicting [h_mode](#h_mode) transitions and transport barrier formation. Related to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) through collision frequency effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) determines coefficients from power balance and particle balance analysis. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides kinetic profiles for coefficient calculation. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction supplies geometric factors including [flux_surface_averaged_major_radius](#flux_surface_averaged_major_radius) and [flux_surface_averaged_magnetic_field_strength](#flux_surface_averaged_magnetic_field_strength). [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) contributes ion temperature and rotation data. Neoclassical formulas include geometric moments and [collisionality](#collisionality) effects from drift kinetic theory.

  Typical values: ITER: $D_{neo} \approx 0.1-1.0$ m$^2$/s, $\chi_{i,e} \approx 0.5-5.0$ m$^2$/s. JET: $D_{neo} \approx 0.05-0.8$ m$^2$/s. DIII-D: $D_{neo} \approx 0.08-1.2$ m$^2$/s. Coefficients decrease significantly in improved confinement modes like [h_mode](#h_mode). Range across machines: 0.05-5.0 m$^2$/s (mean ~1.2 m$^2$/s).

  Sign convention: Positive coefficients indicate outward transport, following standard transport theory conventions where fluxes are positive when directed toward the plasma boundary.
