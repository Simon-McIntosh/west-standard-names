description: Fraction of plasma current provided by bootstrap current mechanism.
documentation: |-
  Bootstrap fraction $f_{bs} = I_{bs}/I_p$ representing the proportion of total plasma current provided by bootstrap current mechanism without external power input. Critical performance parameter for steady-state tokamak operation, with target values of 50-80% for advanced [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Higher bootstrap fractions reduce external [current_drive](#current_drive) requirements and enable more efficient [steady_state_operation](#steady_state_operation). Key performance metric for ITER and future tokamak devices.

  Governing equation:
  $$f_{bs} = \frac{I_{bs}}{I_p} = \frac{\int j_{bs} dA}{\int j_{total} dA}$$

  where $I_{bs}$ is bootstrap current, $I_p$ is total plasma current, $j_{bs}$ is bootstrap current density, and $j_{total}$ is total current density.

  Physical significance: Bootstrap fraction directly determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and sustainability of tokamak operation. Higher fractions reduce auxiliary power requirements for [current_drive](#current_drive) and improve overall [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) efficiency. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design in advanced operating modes. Strongly dependent on [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [collisionality](#collisionality). Essential for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) optimization and scenario planning.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines current profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures kinetic profiles for bootstrap fraction calculations. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides ion temperature data for pressure profiles. Neoclassical codes calculate [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) based on pressure gradients and magnetic geometry. Current profile analysis determines bootstrap fraction from total and bootstrap current profiles.

  Typical values: ITER: $f_{bs} \approx 50-80\%$ in advanced scenarios, target 70% for steady-state operation. JET: $f_{bs} \approx 40-70\%$ in high-performance H-mode. DIII-D: $f_{bs} \approx 45-75\%$ in advanced scenarios. Higher fractions achieved with strong pressure gradients and optimized [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium). Range across machines: 40-80% (mean ~60%).

  Sign convention: Positive fraction indicates bootstrap current flows in standard plasma current direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above).
