description: Theoretical framework describing particle motion in magnetized plasma
  including drifts and collisions.
documentation: |-
  Drift kinetic theory providing the fundamental theoretical framework for describing charged particle motion in magnetized plasmas with finite Larmor radius effects and collisions. Extends guiding-center theory to include grad-B drift, curvature drift, and E×B drift effects combined with Coulomb collision operators. Essential foundation for understanding [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients), [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) generation, and particle orbit dynamics in tokamak magnetic geometry.

  Governing equations:
  $$\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{R}} + \dot{v}_\parallel \frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\parallel} + \dot{\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} = C[f] + S$$

  where $f$ is the particle distribution function, $C[f]$ is the collision operator, $S$ represents sources/sinks, and $\dot{\mathbf{R}}$, $\dot{v}_\parallel$, $\dot{\mu}$ are drift velocities.

  Physical significance: This theory determines [banana_orbits](#banana_orbits) structure and transport coefficients in toroidal geometry. Critical for calculating [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) and [pfirsch_schluter_current](#pfirsch_schluter_current). Directly influences [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) through collision frequency effects. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) modeling and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) analysis. Links to [drift_waves](#drift_waves) through finite Larmor radius stabilization effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) applications of drift kinetic solutions. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction provides geometry for drift calculations. [Fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) relies on drift kinetic orbits. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) and [charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provide kinetic data for theory validation. Computational implementations solve Fokker-Planck equations with magnetic geometry effects.

  Typical values: Theory applicable across all tokamak regimes. Collision frequency $\nu_{ei} \sim 10^3-10^6$ s$^{-1}$, drift frequencies $\omega_d \sim 10^2-10^5$ s$^{-1}$. Valid for $\rho_* = \rho_i/a \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ in ITER, JET, DIII-D. Parameter ranges: $T_e = 1-20$ keV, $n_e = 10^{19}-10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$, $B = 2-6$ T.
