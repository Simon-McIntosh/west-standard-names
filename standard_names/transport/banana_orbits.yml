description: Trapped particle trajectories in toroidal magnetic field with characteristic
  banana shape.
documentation: |-
  Banana orbits representing trapped particle trajectories in toroidal magnetic field geometry where particles with insufficient energy to overcome magnetic mirrors follow characteristic banana-shaped paths in poloidal cross-section. These orbits arise from [drift_kinetic_theory](#drift_kinetic_theory) in toroidal devices where magnetic field strength varies spatially. Banana orbit width and structure determine neoclassical transport coefficients and bootstrap current generation in tokamak plasmas.

  Governing equations:
  $$\Delta R_b = \frac{2\sqrt{2R_0 v_\parallel}}{\omega_{ci} \sqrt{\epsilon}}$$

  $$\Delta Z_b = \frac{2v_\perp}{\omega_{ci}} \sqrt{\frac{2R_0}{r}}$$

  where $\Delta R_b$ and $\Delta Z_b$ are banana orbit width in radial and vertical directions, $R_0$ is major radius, $v_\parallel$ and $v_\perp$ are parallel and perpendicular velocities, $\omega_{ci}$ is ion cyclotron frequency, $\epsilon = r/R_0$ is inverse aspect ratio, and $r$ is minor radius.

  Physical significance: Banana orbits determine trapped particle transport and directly influence [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) in the banana regime. Critical for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [pfirsch_schluter_current](#pfirsch_schluter_current) generation. Strongly dependent on [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and aspect ratio. Affect [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through collisionless damping mechanisms. Related to [collisionality](#collisionality) through orbit width effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines magnetic geometry for orbit calculations. [Fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) analysis tracks banana orbits of energetic particles. [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) includes banana orbit effects on neoclassical transport. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides kinetic data for orbit width predictions. Computational orbit following codes simulate banana orbit dynamics.

  Typical values: ITER: $\Delta R_b \sim 5-20$ cm, $\Delta Z_b \sim 2-8$ cm for thermal ions. JET: $\Delta R_b \sim 3-15$ cm. DIII-D: $\Delta R_b \sim 2-10$ cm. Banana width scales inversely with magnetic field and square root of aspect ratio. Range across machines: 2-20 cm (mean ~8 cm).

  Sign convention: Positive radial width extends outward from magnetic axis, following standard toroidal coordinate conventions where positive radial direction points toward plasma boundary.
