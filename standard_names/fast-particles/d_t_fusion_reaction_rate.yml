description: Rate of deuterium-tritium fusion reactions in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  D-T fusion reaction rate representing the rate of deuterium-tritium fusion reactions in magnetized plasmas. This reaction produces 17.6 MeV of energy per reaction, with 3.5 MeV going to alpha particles and 14.1 MeV to neutrons. The D-T reaction rate determines fusion power output and is the primary reaction of interest for magnetic confinement fusion in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{DT} = \frac{1}{4} n_D n_T \langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT}$$

  where $R_{DT}$ is D-T reaction rate density, $n_D, n_T$ are deuterium and tritium densities, and $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT}$ is the D-T reaction rate coefficient.

  Physical significance: D-T fusion reaction rate determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fusion power generation and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) and alpha particle heating. Strongly coupled to [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density), [alpha_particle_heating](#alpha_particle_heating), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through reaction physics. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and fusion power assessment.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Neutron_flux_measurement](#neutron_flux_measurement) provides direct reaction rate monitoring. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate reaction rates. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures plasma parameters for rate coefficient evaluation. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses reaction rates for power calculations. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: D-T reaction rate 10¹⁸-10²⁰ reactions/m³s at full performance conditions. JET: 10¹⁵-10¹⁸ reactions/m³s during D-T operations. DIII-D: 10¹²-10¹⁵ reactions/m³s for studies. Rate increases exponentially with temperature. Range across machines: 10¹²-10²⁰ reactions/m³s.

  Sign convention: Positive when D-T fusion reaction rate indicates density of fusion reactions producing energy and alpha particles.
