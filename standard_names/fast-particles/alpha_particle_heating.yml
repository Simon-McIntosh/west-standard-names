description: Heating of plasma by fusion-born alpha particles in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Alpha particle heating representing the energy deposition from fusion-born alpha particles (³He nuclei) in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions within magnetized plasmas. These energetic alpha particles (3.5 MeV) thermalize through collisions with plasma electrons and ions, providing the primary heating mechanism for self-heated burning plasmas. Alpha particle heating is fundamental for achieving ignition and sustained fusion reactions in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_\alpha = \frac{1}{4} n_D n_T \langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT} E_\alpha \eta_{thermalization}$$

  where $P_\alpha$ is alpha particle heating power density, $n_D, n_T$ are deuterium and tritium densities, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT}$ is D-T reaction rate coefficient, $E_\alpha = 3.5$ MeV is alpha particle energy, and $\eta_{thermalization}$ is thermalization efficiency.

  Physical significance: Alpha particle heating determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through self-heating and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) ignition in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) and burning plasma physics. Strongly coupled to [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics), [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through alpha particle dynamics. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and fusion reactor optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate alpha heating profiles. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures temperature profiles for heating validation. Fast particle transport codes calculate alpha particle slowing down. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses alpha heating for scenario optimization. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: Alpha heating power density 1-5 MW/m³ with alpha particle energies 3.5 MeV. JET: 0.1-1 MW/m³ during D-T operations. DIII-D: 0.01-0.1 MW/m³ for studies. Alpha thermalization time 0.1-0.5 s depending on plasma conditions. Range across machines: 0.01-5 MW/m³.

  Sign convention: Positive when alpha heating indicates energy transfer from fusion-born alpha particles to thermal plasma through collisional processes.
