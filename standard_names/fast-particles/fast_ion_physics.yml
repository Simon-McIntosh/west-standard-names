description: Physics of energetic ions from neutral beam injection and fusion reactions.
documentation: |-
  Fast ion physics describing the behavior and dynamics of energetic ions from neutral beam injection (NBI) and fusion reactions in magnetized plasmas. These high-energy ions (typically 10-1000 keV) play crucial roles in plasma heating, current drive, and MHD stability. Fast ions from NBI provide both heating and current drive, while fusion-born alpha particles represent the ultimate goal for self-heated burning plasmas. Understanding fast ion behavior is critical for predicting heating deposition profiles and ensuring MHD stability in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{E}{\tau_s} - \nu_{coll} E + P_{deposition}$$

  where $E$ is fast ion energy, $\tau_s$ is slowing-down time, $\nu_{coll}$ is collision frequency, and $P_{deposition}$ is power deposition from external sources.

  Physical significance: Fast ion physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through heating and current drive contributions, directly affecting [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for understanding [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through fast ion-driven instabilities and [current_drive](#current_drive) efficiency. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through orbit effects and to [collisionality](#collisionality) through slowing-down processes. Essential for alpha particle physics in burning plasma scenarios.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures fast ion effects on plasma parameters. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction determines fast ion orbit trajectories. Fast ion transport codes calculate deposition profiles and stability effects. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides complementary fast ion measurements.

  Typical values: ITER: Fast ion energies 100 keV - 3.5 MeV (alpha particles), slowing-down times 0.1-1 s. JET: 50-500 keV for NBI, 10-100 keV for fusion products. DIII-D: 30-300 keV depending on heating method. Fast ion populations can contain 10-30% of total plasma energy.

  Sign convention: Positive when fast ion energy flows from external sources to thermal plasma through collisions and instabilities.
