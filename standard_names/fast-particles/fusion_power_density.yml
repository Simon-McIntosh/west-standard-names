description: Power density from fusion reactions in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Fusion power density representing the power generated per unit volume from fusion reactions in magnetized plasmas. This parameter determines the energy generation rate and heating efficiency in fusion devices, with deuterium-tritium reactions producing the highest power densities for magnetic confinement fusion. Fusion power density is fundamental for assessing reactor performance and optimization in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{fusion} = \frac{1}{4} n_D n_T \langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT} E_{fusion}$$

  where $P_{fusion}$ is fusion power density, $n_D, n_T$ are deuterium and tritium densities, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT}$ is D-T reaction rate coefficient, and $E_{fusion} = 17.6$ MeV is energy per fusion reaction.

  Physical significance: Fusion power density determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through energy generation and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [alpha_particle_heating](#alpha_particle_heating) and burning plasma physics. Strongly coupled to [alpha_particle_heating](#alpha_particle_heating), [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [neutron_flux_measurement](#neutron_flux_measurement) through reaction analysis. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and reactor performance.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Neutron_flux_measurement](#neutron_flux_measurement) provides direct fusion rate monitoring. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate power density profiles. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures plasma parameters for validation. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses power density for reactor assessment. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Fusion power density 1-5 MW/m³ at full performance with Q=10 operation. JET: 0.1-1 MW/m³ during high-power D-T operations. DIII-D: 0.01-0.1 MW/m³ for studies. Power density increases with temperature and density. Range across machines: 0.01-5 MW/m³.

  Sign convention: Positive when fusion power density indicates energy generation rate from deuterium-tritium fusion reactions.
