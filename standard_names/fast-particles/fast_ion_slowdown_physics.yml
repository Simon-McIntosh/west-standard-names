description: Physics of fast ion slowing down and thermalization in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Fast ion slowdown physics representing the energy loss and thermalization processes of energetic ions in magnetized plasmas. This includes both fusion-born alpha particles and ions from neutral beam injection, with slowing down occurring through Coulomb collisions with background plasma particles. Understanding fast ion slowdown is crucial for predicting heating profiles and maintaining plasma performance in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{E}{\tau_s} - \nu_{coll} E$$

  where $E$ is fast ion energy, $\tau_s$ is slowing-down time, and $\nu_{coll}$ is collision frequency with background plasma.

  Physical significance: Fast ion slowdown physics determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through heating profiles and directly affects [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [heating_deposition](#heating_deposition) and current drive effectiveness. Strongly coupled to [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics), [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [collisionality](#collisionality) through collision processes. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and heating control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Fast particle transport codes calculate slowing-down processes. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures temperature profiles for validation. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides fast ion measurements. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses slowdown physics for heating predictions. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design.

  Typical values: ITER: Slowing-down time 0.1-1 s for 3.5 MeV alpha particles in hot plasmas. JET: 0.05-0.5 s for various fast ion species. DIII-D: 0.02-0.2 s depending on plasma conditions. Time decreases with increasing background plasma density. Range across machines: 0.02-1 s.

  Sign convention: Positive when slowing-down rate indicates energy loss from fast ions to background plasma through Coulomb collisions.
