description: Height (Z coordinate) of the second point defining the spectrometer line
  of sight.
documentation: Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the second endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight. Together with the first point coordinates, defines the
  complete 3D geometry of the diagnostic viewing chord through the plasma. The chord
  path determines which plasma regions contribute to the measured spectral signals.
