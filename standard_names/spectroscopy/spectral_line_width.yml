description: Spectral line width measurement from plasma emission.
documentation: |-
  Spectral line width $\Delta \lambda$ measurement from plasma emission spectroscopy, representing the wavelength distribution of emitted radiation. Line width provides information about [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and plasma turbulence through Doppler and pressure broadening.

  $$\Delta \lambda_{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2\ln 2} \frac{\lambda_0}{c} \sqrt{\frac{2k_B T_i}{m_i} + \frac{k_B T_e}{m_e}}$$

  where $\lambda_0$ is rest wavelength, $T_i$ is [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), $m_i$ is ion mass, $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), and $m_e$ is electron mass.

  Physical significance:

  Spectral line width provides information about [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and plasma turbulence through Doppler broadening and Stark effects. Line width analysis gives information about ion velocity distribution and microturbulence. Spectroscopy complement other diagnostics with velocity information. See [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) for temperature relationships and [turbulence](#turbulence) for fluctuation effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Line width relates to temperature and turbulence:

  $$\Delta \lambda_{total}^2 = \Delta \lambda_{thermal}^2 + \Delta \lambda_{turbulence}^2 + \Delta \lambda_{instrument}^2$$

  where thermal, turbulent, and instrumental contributions add in quadrature.

  Measurement methods:

  Spectral line widths are measured using high-resolution spectrometers with calibrated wavelength scales. Multiple lines provide temperature information. Background subtraction removes continuum emission. Instrumental broadening is characterized and subtracted. Time-resolved measurements study line width dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected line widths of 0.01-0.1 nm for typical ion temperatures and turbulence levels. JET: Typical widths 0.005-0.05 nm for standard operations. DIII-D: Width ranges 0.001-0.01 nm depending on plasma conditions. Spectral resolution typically 0.001 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive line width indicates full width at half maximum of spectral line, following standard spectroscopy conventions and line shape analysis.
