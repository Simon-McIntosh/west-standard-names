description: 3D position vector of the second point defining the spectrometer line
  of sight.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, \u03C6, Z) of the second endpoint\
  \ defining the spectrometer diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates.\
  \ Together with the first point, the line segment between these vectors determines\
  \ the complete diagnostic viewing chord geometry and the spatial integration path\
  \ for all spectroscopic measurements."
