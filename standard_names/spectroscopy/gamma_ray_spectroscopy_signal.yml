description: Gamma ray emission signal from plasma gamma ray spectroscopy diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Gamma ray spectroscopy signal representing gamma ray emissions from nuclear reactions and activation in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique measures high-energy photon emissions (typically 0.1-10 MeV) from fusion reactions, impurity activation, and nuclear processes in tokamak plasmas. Gamma ray spectroscopy provides information on fusion reaction rates, impurity content, and nuclear heating in fusion devices.

  Governing equation:
  $$S_\gamma = \frac{dN_\gamma}{dt} = n_i n_j \langle \sigma v \rangle \cdot V \cdot \epsilon_{detector}$$

  where $S_\gamma$ is gamma ray signal rate, $n_i, n_j$ are reactant densities, $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is reaction rate coefficient, $V$ is plasma volume, and $\epsilon_{detector}$ is detector efficiency.

  Physical significance: Gamma ray spectroscopy signal determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fusion reaction monitoring and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) validation. Critical for understanding [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) and nuclear processes in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics) diagnostics, [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [nuclear_heating_rate](#nuclear_heating_rate) through reaction analysis. Essential for [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) measurement and nuclear diagnostics.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: High-purity germanium detectors measure gamma ray spectra with high energy resolution. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate expected gamma ray signals. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses gamma ray data for reaction rate validation. [Nuclear_heating_rate](#nuclear_heating_rate) calculations correlate with gamma ray measurements. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Gamma ray signals 10³-10⁶ counts/s for D-T fusion reactions at full power. JET: 10²-10⁴ counts/s during high-power operations. DIII-D: 10¹-10³ counts/s for impurity activation studies. Energy resolution typically 1-10 keV depending on detector system. Range across machines: 10¹-10⁶ counts/s.

  Sign convention: Positive when signal rates indicate gamma ray emission from nuclear reactions and activation processes in the plasma.
