description: Uncalibrated intensity spectrum measured by spectrometer detector.
documentation: |-
  Intensity spectrum representing the number of photoelectrons detected per unit time by each wavelength pixel of the spectrometer channel. This is raw or minimally processed data that includes electronic gain compensation and relative channel calibration but not absolute radiometric calibration. Units are counts per second (s⁻¹). Used for qualitative analysis or when absolute calibration is unavailable. Convert to calibrated spectral radiance using detector sensitivity and system throughput calibration factors.

  Governing equation:
  $$I_{counts}(\lambda) = \frac{dN_{photo}}{dt} = \eta_{quantum}(\lambda) \cdot \Phi_{photon}(\lambda) \cdot G_{electronics}$$

  where $\eta_{quantum}$ is quantum efficiency, $\Phi_{photon}$ is photon flux, and $G_{electronics}$ is electronic gain.

  Physical significance: This quantity represents raw [spectroscopic_measurements](#spectroscopic_measurements) data before radiometric calibration, providing information about [plasma_emission](#plasma_emission) patterns and [spectral_line_intensity](#spectral_line_intensity) distributions. Critical for [qualitative_analysis](#qualitative_analysis) when absolute calibration is not available. Strongly coupled to [detector_response](#detector_response), [spectral_calibration](#spectral_calibration), and [photon_detection](#photon_detection) efficiency. Essential for [plasma_diagnostics](#plasma_diagnostics) and [spectral_analysis](#spectral_analysis) in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [CCD_detectors](#CCD_detectors) measure photon counts with high sensitivity and low noise. [Photomultiplier_tubes](#Photomultiplier_tubes) provide time-resolved measurements for dynamic studies. [Electronic_gain](#electronic_gain) systems amplify weak signals for detection. [Spectral_calibration](#spectral_calibration) uses known emission lines for wavelength reference. Raw data processing includes dark current subtraction and background correction.

  Typical values: ITER: Expected count rates 10²-10⁶ s⁻¹ depending on plasma emission and integration time. JET: Typical rates 10¹-10⁵ s⁻¹ for standard operations. DIII-D: Count ranges 10⁰-10⁴ s⁻¹ depending on plasma conditions and detector configuration. Signal-to-noise ratio typically 10:1 to 100:1 for calibrated systems.

  Sign convention: Positive count rates indicate detected photon events per unit time, with higher values corresponding to stronger spectral emission at specific wavelengths.
