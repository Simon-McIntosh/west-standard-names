description: Spectral line measurement from X-ray crystal spectroscopy diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  X-ray crystal spectroscopy line representing characteristic X-ray emissions from highly charged ions in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique uses crystal diffraction to measure high-resolution X-ray spectra from impurity ions, providing information on ion temperature, velocity, and impurity concentrations. X-ray crystal spectroscopy is essential for understanding impurity transport and radiation losses in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{hc}{2d \sin\theta}$$

  where $E$ is photon energy, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is speed of light, $\lambda$ is wavelength, $d$ is crystal lattice spacing, and $\theta$ is Bragg angle.

  Physical significance: X-ray crystal spectroscopy line determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through impurity monitoring and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for understanding [impurity_transport](#impurity_transport) and radiation losses in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [spectroscopy](#spectroscopy) systems, [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through impurity analysis. Essential for [impurity_transport](#impurity_transport) studies and radiation control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Crystal spectrometers measure X-ray spectra with high energy resolution. [Spectroscopy](#spectroscopy) analysis determines ion temperatures from line broadening. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary temperature validation. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses X-ray data for impurity studies. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: X-ray lines 1-10 keV for highly charged tungsten and beryllium impurities. JET: 0.5-8 keV for various impurity species. DIII-D: 0.3-6 keV with high spectral resolution. Energy resolution typically 1-10 eV depending on crystal configuration. Range across machines: 0.3-10 keV.

  Sign convention: Positive when spectral line intensities indicate impurity emission from highly charged ions in the plasma.
