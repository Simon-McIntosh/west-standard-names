description: Spectral line intensity from plasma emission.
documentation: |-
  Spectral line intensity $I_{\lambda}$ measurement from plasma emission spectroscopy, representing the power radiated per unit solid angle per unit wavelength. Line intensity provides information about [ion_density](#ion_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature).

  $$I_{\lambda} = \frac{hc}{4\pi \lambda} A_{ul} n_u \frac{g_u}{g_l} \exp\left(-\frac{E_u - E_l}{k_B T_e}\right)$$

  where $A_{ul}$ is Einstein coefficient, $n_u$ is upper state density, $g_u, g_l$ are statistical weights, $E_u, E_l$ are energy levels, and $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature).

  Physical significance:

  Spectral line intensity provides information about [ion_density](#ion_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through atomic physics relationships. Line ratios give temperature measurements, while absolute intensities provide density information. Spectroscopy complement [thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) with impurity and ion species information. See [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature relationships and [ion_density](#ion_density) for density effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Line intensity relates to ion density and temperature:

  $$I_{\lambda} \propto n_i n_e \exp\left(-\frac{E_{excitation}}{k_B T_e}\right)$$

  where $n_i$ is ion density and $E_{excitation}$ is excitation energy.

  Measurement methods:

  Spectral line intensities are measured using spectrometers with calibrated detectors. Multiple spectral lines provide temperature and density information. Absolute calibration uses known light sources. Background subtraction removes continuum emission. Time-resolved measurements study dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected line intensities of 10^15-10^18 W/sr for typical impurity lines. JET: Typical intensities 10^13-10^16 W/sr for standard operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^12-10^15 W/sr depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5%.

  Sign convention: Positive line intensity indicates measured power per unit solid angle at specific wavelengths, following standard spectroscopy conventions and radiometry principles.
