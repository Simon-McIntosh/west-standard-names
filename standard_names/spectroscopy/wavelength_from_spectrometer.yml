description: Wavelength coordinate for spectroscopic measurements in the visible light
  range.
documentation: Wavelength coordinate array for grating spectrometer measurements in
  the visible light range (typically 380-750 nm). Each element corresponds to a wavelength
  pixel or channel of the detector. Wavelength calibration is typically performed
  using known spectral lines from plasma impurities or external sources. The wavelength
  resolution depends on the grating groove density and detector pixel size.
