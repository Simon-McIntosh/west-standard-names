description: Temperature characterizing the hot neutral population for a specific
  isotope.
documentation: 'Temperature characterizing the energy distribution of the hot neutral
  population for a specific isotope, typically tens of eV to keV. Determined from
  the broad Doppler-broadened component of spectral lines. Hot neutrals are produced
  by charge exchange: $Ion^+ + Neutral^0 \rightarrow Ion^0 + Neutral^+$, carrying
  away energy comparable to the ion temperature. Multi-component line fitting separates
  hot and cold populations. Hot neutral temperature approximates local ion temperature
  in regions where charge exchange is active.'
