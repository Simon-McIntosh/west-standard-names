description: Temperature characterizing the hot neutral population for a specific
  isotope.
documentation: |-
  Temperature $T_{hot}$ characterizing the energy distribution of the hot neutral population for a specific isotope, typically tens of eV to keV representing energetic neutral atoms produced in fusion plasmas. Determined from the broad Doppler-broadened component of spectral lines, where the line width $\Delta\lambda$ relates to temperature through kinetic theory. Hot neutrals are produced by charge exchange reactions: $Ion^+ + Neutral^0 \rightarrow Ion^0 + Neutral^+$, carrying away energy comparable to the ion temperature.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{mc^2}}$$

  where $\Delta\lambda$ is Doppler broadening, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature, $m$ is neutral mass, and $c$ is speed of light.

  Physical significance: Hot neutral temperature approximates local [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) in regions where charge exchange is active, providing indirect ion temperature measurements. Critical for [charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) assessment. Strongly coupled to [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) through neutral transport and to [collisionality](#collisionality) through charge exchange rates. Essential for understanding fast neutral physics and diagnostic applications in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides high-resolution spectral line measurements for Doppler broadening analysis. Multi-component line fitting separates hot and cold neutral populations. Neutral transport codes calculate hot neutral production rates. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) validates ion temperature correlation. Spectroscopic analysis determines temperature from line profile fitting.

  Typical values: ITER: Hot neutral temperatures 100 eV - 5 keV in core regions, 10-100 eV in edge regions. JET: 50 eV - 3 keV depending on plasma conditions. DIII-D: 30 eV - 2 keV for standard operations. Higher temperatures in regions with strong charge exchange activity.

  Sign convention: Positive temperature indicates thermal energy of neutral population, with multi-component fitting distinguishing hot and cold components through line broadening analysis.
