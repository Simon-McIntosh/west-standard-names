description: Spectral measurement from charge exchange recombination spectroscopy
  diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) representing spectral measurements from charge exchange reactions between plasma ions and neutral atoms in magnetized plasmas. This diagnostic technique provides high-resolution measurements of ion temperature, plasma rotation, and impurity concentrations through analysis of Doppler-broadened spectral lines. CXRS is fundamental for understanding ion transport and momentum balance in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta\lambda = \lambda_0 \frac{v}{c} \cos\theta$$

  where $\Delta\lambda$ is Doppler shift, $\lambda_0$ is rest wavelength, $v$ is ion velocity, $c$ is speed of light, and $\theta$ is viewing angle.

  Physical significance: Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through ion transport analysis and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization. Critical for understanding [momentum_balance](#momentum_balance) and [transport](#transport) physics in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [spectroscopy](#spectroscopy) systems, [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature), and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through rotation measurements. Essential for [transport](#transport) analysis and momentum balance studies.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: High-resolution spectrometers measure Doppler-broadened spectral lines. [Spectroscopy](#spectroscopy) analysis determines ion temperatures and velocities. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary measurements. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses CXRS data for transport studies. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: CXRS spectral lines 400-700 nm for hydrogenic carbon and nitrogen. JET: 350-650 nm for various impurity species. DIII-D: 300-600 nm with high temporal resolution. Spectral resolution typically 0.01-0.1 nm. Range across machines: 300-700 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive when spectral line intensities indicate charge exchange reaction rates from neutral beam injection.
