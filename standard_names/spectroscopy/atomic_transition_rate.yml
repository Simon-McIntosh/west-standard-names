description: Atomic transition rate measurement from spectroscopy.
documentation: |-
  Atomic transition rate $A_{ul}$ measurement, representing the probability per unit time for spontaneous emission from upper to lower atomic state. Transition rates are fundamental atomic physics parameters used in spectroscopy analysis.

  $$A_{ul} = \frac{64\pi^4 \nu^3}{3hc^3} |\langle u|\mathbf{r}|l\rangle|^2$$

  where $\nu$ is transition frequency, $\mathbf{r}$ is position operator, and $|u\rangle, |l\rangle$ are upper and lower states.

  Physical significance:

  Atomic transition rates are fundamental parameters for spectroscopy analysis and plasma diagnostics. Rates determine line intensities and are used in collisional-radiative modeling. Transition rates complement spectral line measurements with atomic physics context. See [spectral_line_intensity](#spectral_line_intensity) for intensity relationships and [atomic_physics](#atomic_physics) for fundamental parameters.

  Measurement relation:

  Transition rate relates to line strength:

  $$A_{ul} = \frac{8\pi^2 \nu^2}{m_e c \epsilon_0 h} f_{lu}$$

  where $f_{lu}$ is oscillator strength and $\nu$ is frequency.

  Measurement methods:

  Atomic transition rates are determined from laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations. High-resolution spectroscopy measures line strengths and branching ratios. Time-resolved measurements study decay dynamics. Multiple transitions provide cross-validation. Theoretical calculations complement experimental measurements.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected transition rates of 10^6-10^9 s^-1 for typical atomic transitions. JET: Typical rates 10^7-10^10 s^-1 for standard transitions. DIII-D: Rate ranges 10^8-10^11 s^-1 depending on atomic species. Measurement precision typically 1-5%.

  Sign convention: Positive transition rate indicates probability per unit time for spontaneous emission, following standard atomic physics and quantum mechanics conventions.
