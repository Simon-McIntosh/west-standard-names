description: Number of atoms of a specific element present in a molecule.
documentation: "Number of atoms of a specific element within a molecule. For atomic\
  \ species this is 1 (e.g., H, D, He). For diatomic molecules: 2 (e.g., H\u2082,\
  \ D\u2082, HD). For more complex molecules, the stoichiometric coefficient for that\
  \ element (e.g., for CH\u2084, carbon has 1, hydrogen has 4). Used to interpret\
  \ molecular spectroscopy and calculate molecular densities from measured emission\
  \ intensities."
