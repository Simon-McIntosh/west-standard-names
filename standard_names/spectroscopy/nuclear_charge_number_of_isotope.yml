description: Nuclear charge number (Z) of an element in elementary charge units.
documentation: 'Nuclear charge number Z of an element, representing the number of
  protons in the nucleus, expressed in elementary charge units (e). For hydrogen isotopes
  (H, D, T): $Z = 1$. For helium isotopes: $Z = 2$. This determines the element identity
  and, together with the atomic mass number A, uniquely identifies the isotope. Essential
  for spectral line identification as Z determines the electronic structure and emission
  spectrum.'
