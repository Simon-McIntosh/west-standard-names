description: Signal-to-noise ratio for spectroscopic measurements expressed in decibels.
documentation: 'Signal-to-noise ratio quantifying the quality of spectroscopic measurements,
  expressed in decibels (dB). Calculated as $\text{SNR}_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(P_{signal}/P_{noise})$
  where $P_{signal}$ is the spectral power in the band containing lines of interest
  and $P_{noise}$ is the power in a reference band without spectral lines. Higher
  values indicate better measurement quality. Typical values: >10 dB for reliable
  measurements, >20 dB for high precision analysis. Used to validate measurement quality
  for isotope ratio analysis and other quantitative diagnostics.'
