description: Major radius (R coordinate) of the first point defining the spectrometer
  line of sight.
documentation: 'Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the first endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, φ, Z). Together with the
  second point, this defines the viewing chord geometry through the plasma. The line
  of sight determines the spatial integration volume for emitted radiation measurements.
  Coordinate convention: R is measured from the tokamak major axis (Z-axis) outward
  in the horizontal plane.'
