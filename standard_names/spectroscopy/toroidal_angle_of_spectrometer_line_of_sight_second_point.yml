name: toroidal_angle_of_spectrometer_line_of_sight_second_point
description: Toroidal angle (φ coordinate) of the second point defining the spectrometer
  line of sight.
documentation: 'Toroidal angle coordinate φ of the second endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight. Convention: φ oriented counter-clockwise when viewing
  from above. For tangential views, the difference between first and second point
  toroidal angles determines the viewing geometry relative to magnetic field lines.'
