description: Major radius (R coordinate) of the second point defining the spectrometer
  line of sight.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the second endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, φ, Z). Together with the
  first point, this defines the complete viewing chord geometry. The line segment
  between first and second points determines the spatial integration path for line-integrated
  spectroscopic measurements.
