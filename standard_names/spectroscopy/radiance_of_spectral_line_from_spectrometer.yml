name: radiance_of_spectral_line_from_spectrometer
description: Calibrated radiance of an identified spectral line integrated over its
  wavelength range.
documentation: 'Calibrated radiance of a specific spectral line, integrated over the
  wavelength extent of the line and with background continuum subtracted. Units: $W
  \cdot m^{-2} \cdot sr^{-1}$. This integrated line radiance is proportional to the
  emissivity of the corresponding atomic or ionic transition, which depends on species
  density, temperature, and excitation/ionization balance. Used for impurity concentration
  measurements, plasma temperature inference, and particle transport studies.'
