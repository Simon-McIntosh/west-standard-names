description: Uncalibrated intensity spectrum measured by spectrometer detector.
documentation: "Intensity spectrum representing the number of photoelectrons detected\
  \ per unit time by each wavelength pixel of the spectrometer channel. This is raw\
  \ or minimally processed data that includes electronic gain compensation and relative\
  \ channel calibration but not absolute radiometric calibration. Units are counts\
  \ per second (s\u207B\xB9). Used for qualitative analysis or when absolute calibration\
  \ is unavailable. Convert to calibrated spectral radiance using detector sensitivity\
  \ and system throughput calibration factors."
