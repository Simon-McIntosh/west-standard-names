name: spectrometer_intensity_of_spectral_line
description: Uncalibrated intensity of an identified spectral line integrated over
  its wavelength range.
documentation: 'Uncalibrated intensity of a specific spectral line, integrated over
  the wavelength extent of the line. Represents the total photoelectron count rate
  for the line after background subtraction but before absolute radiometric calibration.
  Units: counts per second (s⁻¹). Useful for qualitative monitoring of line emission
  trends and relative intensity comparisons when absolute calibration is not required
  or available.'
