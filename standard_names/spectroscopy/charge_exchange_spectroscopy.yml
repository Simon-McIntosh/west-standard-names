  exchange reactions.
documentation: |-
  Charge exchange spectroscopy (CXRS) measuring ion temperature and velocity from charge exchange reactions between plasma ions and neutral atoms in magnetized plasmas. This essential diagnostic technique uses neutral beam injection to create charge exchange reactions that provide local ion measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. CXRS is fundamental for understanding ion temperature profiles, plasma rotation, and impurity behavior in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dN}{dt} = n_i n_0 \langle \sigma v \rangle_{CX} - \frac{N}{\tau}$$

  where $N$ is excited state population, $n_i$ is ion density, $n_0$ is neutral density, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{CX}$ is charge exchange rate coefficient, and $\tau$ is excited state lifetime.

  Physical significance: Charge exchange spectroscopy determines [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fundamental ion measurements. Critical for [transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction. Strongly coupled to [fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) through neutral beam interactions and to [collisionality](#collisionality) through charge exchange rates. Essential for understanding ion species behavior and impurity transport in tokamak scenarios.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: High-resolution spectrometers measure Doppler-broadened spectral lines from charge exchange reactions. Multiple viewing chords provide radial profiles of ion temperature and rotation. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides complementary electron measurements. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses CXRS data for equilibrium constraints.

  Typical values: ITER: Spectral line intensities 10^14-10^17 W/sr for hydrogenic lines, spectral resolution 0.01 nm. JET: 10^12-10^15 W/sr for standard operations. DIII-D: 10^11-10^14 W/sr depending on beam power. Temperature precision typically 5-10%.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured intensity indicates charge exchange reaction rate, with Doppler shift giving ion velocity information.
