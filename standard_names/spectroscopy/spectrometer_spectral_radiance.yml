description: Calibrated spectral radiance (radiance per unit wavelength) measured
  by spectrometer.
documentation: |-
  Calibrated spectral radiance measured by visible light spectrometer, defined as radiant intensity per unit wavelength interval per unit solid angle per unit projected source area. Units: $W \cdot m^{-2} \cdot sr^{-1} \cdot m^{-1}$ where the final $m^{-1}$ represents per unit wavelength. Calibration accounts for detector sensitivity, optical throughput, and geometric factors. Used for quantitative analysis of plasma emission including line intensities, continuum radiation, and impurity concentrations.

  Governing equation:
  $$L_{\lambda}(\lambda) = \frac{d^3 \Phi}{dA \, d\Omega \, d\lambda} = \frac{I_{counts}(\lambda)}{C_{calibration}(\lambda) \cdot \Delta\lambda \cdot \Delta\Omega \cdot A_{effective}}$$

  where $I_{counts}$ is measured count rate, $C_{calibration}$ is calibration factor, $\Delta\lambda$ is wavelength resolution, $\Delta\Omega$ is solid angle, and $A_{effective}$ is effective area.

  Physical significance: This quantity provides absolute [plasma_emission](#plasma_emission) measurements for [quantitative_spectroscopy](#quantitative_spectroscopy) and [impurity_analysis](#impurity_analysis). Calibrated radiance enables accurate [spectral_line_intensity](#spectral_line_intensity) measurements and [plasma_parameter](#plasma_parameter) determination. Critical for [radiative_losses](#radiative_losses) calculation and [energy_balance](#energy_balance) analysis. Strongly coupled to [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [ion_density](#ion_density), and [plasma_composition](#plasma_composition). Essential for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) assessment and [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Absolute_calibration](#absolute_calibration) uses calibrated light sources and reference standards. [Radiometric_standards](#radiometric_standards) provide traceable calibration factors. [Optical_throughput](#optical_throughput) measurements account for system efficiency. [Geometric_factors](#geometric_factors) include solid angle and area corrections. [Spectral_calibration](#spectral_calibration) ensures wavelength accuracy for quantitative analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: Expected spectral radiances 10⁻⁶-10⁻² W·m⁻²·sr⁻¹·nm⁻¹ for typical plasma emission lines. JET: Typical radiances 10⁻⁷-10⁻³ W·m⁻²·sr⁻¹·nm⁻¹ for standard operations. DIII-D: Radiance ranges 10⁻⁸-10⁻⁴ W·m⁻²·sr⁻¹·nm⁻¹ depending on plasma conditions. Calibration accuracy typically 5-10% for absolute measurements.

  Sign convention: Positive spectral radiance indicates radiant energy flow per unit area per unit solid angle per unit wavelength, with higher values corresponding to stronger plasma emission at specific wavelengths.
