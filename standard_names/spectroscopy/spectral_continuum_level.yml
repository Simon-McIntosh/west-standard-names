description: Spectral continuum level measurement from plasma.
documentation: |-
  Spectral continuum level $I_{cont}$ measurement from plasma emission, representing the background radiation between spectral lines. Continuum measurement provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through free-free and free-bound transitions.

  $$I_{cont}(\lambda) = n_e \sum_i n_i Z_i^2 T_e^{-1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T_e}\right) \gamma(\lambda, T_e)$$

  where $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $n_i$ is ion density, $Z_i$ is atomic number, $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), and $\gamma$ is Gaunt factor.

  Physical significance:

  Spectral continuum level provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through continuum radiation analysis. Continuum complement line emission with background plasma information. Spectroscopy measure total emission for [radiation_diagnostics](#radiation_diagnostics) analysis. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Continuum level relates to plasma parameters:

  $$I_{cont} \propto n_e n_i Z_i^2 T_e^{-1/2}$$

  where the temperature dependence determines continuum slope.

  Measurement methods:

  Spectral continuum is measured using broadband detectors with line emission subtracted. Multiple wavelengths provide temperature information. Absolute calibration uses known radiation sources. Background subtraction removes instrumental effects. Time-resolved measurements study continuum dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected continuum levels of 10^14-10^17 W/sr/nm for typical plasma parameters. JET: Typical levels 10^12-10^15 W/sr/nm for standard operations. DIII-D: Level ranges 10^11-10^14 W/sr/nm depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5%.

  Sign convention: Positive continuum level indicates measured power per unit wavelength, following standard radiometry and spectroscopy conventions.
