description: Height (Z coordinate) of the first point defining the spectrometer line
  of sight.
documentation: "Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the first endpoint of the spectrometer\
  \ diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, \u03C6, Z). Z is measured\
  \ vertically along the tokamak symmetry axis, typically with Z = 0 at the machine\
  \ midplane. Positive Z is upward direction. This coordinate, together with R and\
  \ \u03C6, defines the 3D starting position of the diagnostic viewing chord."
