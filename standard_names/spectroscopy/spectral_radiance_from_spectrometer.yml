description: Calibrated spectral radiance (radiance per unit wavelength) measured
  by spectrometer.
documentation: 'Calibrated spectral radiance measured by visible light spectrometer,
  defined as radiant intensity per unit wavelength interval per unit solid angle per
  unit projected source area. Units: $W \cdot m^{-2} \cdot sr^{-1} \cdot m^{-1}$ where
  the final $m^{-1}$ represents per unit wavelength. Calibration accounts for detector
  sensitivity, optical throughput, and geometric factors. Used for quantitative analysis
  of plasma emission including line intensities, continuum radiation, and impurity
  concentrations.'
