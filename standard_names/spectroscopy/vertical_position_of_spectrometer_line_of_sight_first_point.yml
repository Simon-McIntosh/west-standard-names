description: Height (Z coordinate) of the first point defining the spectrometer line
  of sight.
documentation: Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the first endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, φ, Z). Z is measured vertically
  along the tokamak symmetry axis, typically with Z = 0 at the machine midplane. Positive
  Z is upward direction. This coordinate, together with R and φ, defines the 3D starting
  position of the diagnostic viewing chord.
