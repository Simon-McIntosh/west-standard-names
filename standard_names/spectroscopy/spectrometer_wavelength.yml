description: Wavelength coordinate for spectroscopic measurements in the visible light
  range.
documentation: |-
  Wavelength coordinate array for grating spectrometer measurements in the visible light range (typically 380-750 nm). Each element corresponds to a wavelength pixel or channel of the detector. Wavelength calibration is typically performed using known spectral lines from plasma impurities or external sources. The wavelength resolution depends on the grating groove density and detector pixel size.

  Governing equation:
  $$\lambda(m) = \frac{d}{m} \left( \sin\alpha + \sin\beta \right) = \frac{d}{m} \left( \sin\alpha + \sin(\alpha + \theta) \right)$$

  where $d$ is grating spacing, $m$ is diffraction order, $\alpha$ is incidence angle, $\beta$ is diffraction angle, and $\theta$ is rotation angle.

  Physical significance: This quantity provides the fundamental [spectral_coordinate](#spectral_coordinate) for [spectroscopic_analysis](#spectroscopic_analysis) and [plasma_diagnostics](#plasma_diagnostics). Accurate wavelength calibration is essential for [spectral_line_identification](#spectral_line_identification) and [atomic_transition](#atomic_transition) analysis. Critical for [impurity_spectroscopy](#impurity_spectroscopy) and [plasma_composition](#plasma_composition) determination. Strongly coupled to [spectral_resolution](#spectral_resolution), [grating_efficiency](#grating_efficiency), and [detector_response](#detector_response). Essential for [quantitative_spectroscopy](#quantitative_spectroscopy) and [plasma_parameter](#plasma_parameter) measurements in tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Grating_equation](#grating_equation) calculations determine theoretical wavelength positions. [Calibration_lamps](#calibration_lamps) provide known spectral lines for reference. [Plasma_impurity_lines](#plasma_impurity_lines) serve as internal calibration standards. [Interferometric_methods](#interferometric_methods) ensure high-precision wavelength determination. [Pixel_mapping](#pixel_mapping) relates detector positions to wavelengths with sub-pixel accuracy.

  Typical values: ITER: Wavelength coverage 350-800 nm with resolution 0.01-0.1 nm depending on configuration. JET: Typical coverage 400-700 nm with 0.02-0.05 nm resolution. DIII-D: Coverage ranges 380-750 nm with 0.005-0.02 nm resolution. Calibration accuracy typically ±0.001 nm for well-characterized systems.

  Sign convention: Positive wavelength values indicate electromagnetic radiation frequency, with shorter wavelengths corresponding to higher energy photons and longer wavelengths to lower energy photons.
