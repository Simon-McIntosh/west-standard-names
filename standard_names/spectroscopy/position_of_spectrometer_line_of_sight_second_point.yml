name: position_of_spectrometer_line_of_sight_second_point
description: Position vector of the second point defining the spectrometer line of
  sight.
documentation: Three-dimensional position vector (R, φ, Z) of the second endpoint
  defining the spectrometer diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates. Together
  with the first point, the line segment between these vectors determines the complete
  diagnostic viewing chord geometry and the spatial integration path for all spectroscopic
  measurements.
