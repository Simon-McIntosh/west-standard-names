name: cold_neutral_fraction_of_isotope
description: Fraction of cold neutrals relative to total neutrals for a specific isotope.
documentation: Fraction of cold neutrals relative to the total neutral population
  for a specific isotope, defined as $f_{cold} = n_{cold} / (n_{cold} + n_{hot})$
  where $n_{cold}$ and $n_{hot}$ are the cold and hot neutral densities respectively.
  Dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. Cold neutrals typically originate from molecular
  dissociation and wall recycling (energies <1 eV), while hot neutrals come from charge
  exchange with plasma ions (energies ~keV). Determined from spectral line shape analysis
  including Doppler broadening and line intensities.
