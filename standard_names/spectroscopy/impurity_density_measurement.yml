description: Impurity density measurement from spectroscopy.
documentation: |-
  Impurity density measurement $n_{imp}$ from spectroscopy, representing the concentration of impurity species in plasma. Impurity densities are determined from spectral line intensities and atomic physics modeling.

  $$n_{imp} = \frac{I_{\lambda}}{n_e} \frac{1}{\langle \sigma v \rangle_{excitation} \Delta E}$$

  where $I_{\lambda}$ is spectral line intensity, $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{excitation}$ is excitation rate coefficient, and $\Delta E$ is energy per photon.

  Physical significance:

  Impurity density measurements are crucial for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) and [radiation_diagnostics](#radiation_diagnostics) analysis. Impurities affect [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through increased radiation losses. Spectroscopy provides species-specific impurity information. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) for performance effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Impurity density relates to radiation and performance:

  $$P_{rad} = \sum_i n_e n_i Z_i^2 \Lambda_i(T_e)$$

  where $P_{rad}$ is radiated power, $Z_i$ is atomic number, and $\Lambda_i$ is cooling rate.

  Measurement methods:

  Impurity densities are measured using multiple spectral lines from different ionization stages. Absolute intensities require careful calibration. Abel inversion gives radial profiles. Time-resolved measurements study impurity transport. Multiple species are analyzed simultaneously.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected impurity densities of 10^15-10^18 m^-3 for typical impurity concentrations. JET: Typical densities 10^14-10^17 m^-3 for standard operations. DIII-D: Density ranges 10^13-10^16 m^-3 depending on wall conditions. Measurement precision typically 10%.

  Sign convention: Positive impurity density indicates number of impurity ions per unit volume, following standard density definitions and plasma physics conventions.
