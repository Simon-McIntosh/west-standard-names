name: neutral_density_ratio_of_isotope
description: Ratio of neutral density of an isotope to the sum of all other measured
  isotope neutral densities.
documentation: 'Ratio of the neutral density of a specific isotope to the summed neutral
  densities of all other isotopes in the measurement set, defined as $n_i / \sum_{j
  \neq i} n_j$ where $n_i$ is the neutral density of isotope $i$. Dimensionless quantity
  derived from spectral line intensity ratios of isotope-specific transitions. Used
  for fuel isotope mix analysis in deuterium-tritium plasmas and wall recycling studies.
  Typical values: 0.1-10 depending on fueling mix and recycling sources.'
