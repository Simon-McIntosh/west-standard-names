description: Motional Stark effect wavelength shift measurement.
documentation: |-
  Motional Stark effect wavelength shift $\Delta \lambda_{MSE}$ from neutral beam spectroscopy, representing the wavelength shift due to electric fields in the beam frame. MSE provides direct [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measurements for equilibrium reconstruction.

  $$\Delta \lambda_{MSE} = \frac{\lambda_0^2}{hc} \frac{e \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{c}$$

  where $\mathbf{E}$ is electric field, $\mathbf{v}$ is beam velocity, and $\lambda_0$ is rest wavelength.

  Physical significance:

  Motional Stark effect provides direct measurement of [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) orientation and strength through electric field effects in the beam frame. MSE is crucial for [equilibrium_reconstruction](#equilibrium_reconstruction) and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profile determination. Spectroscopy complement magnetic diagnostics with local field measurements. See [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field relationships and [equilibrium_reconstruction](#equilibrium_reconstruction) for reconstruction applications.

  Measurement relation:

  MSE shift relates to magnetic field:

  $$\Delta \lambda_{MSE} = \frac{\lambda_0}{c} v_B B_{\perp} \sin\theta$$

  where $v_B$ is beam velocity, $B_{\perp}$ is perpendicular magnetic field, and $\theta$ is pitch angle.

  Measurement methods:

  MSE uses neutral beam injection with high-resolution spectroscopy to measure Stark splitting. Multiple viewing chords provide magnetic field profiles. Polarization analysis gives field direction information. Calibration uses known magnetic fields and beam energies. Real-time measurements support control systems.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected MSE shifts of 0.1-1 nm for typical beam energies and magnetic fields. JET: Typical shifts 0.05-0.5 nm for standard operations. DIII-D: Shift ranges 0.01-0.1 nm depending on beam and field conditions. Spectral resolution typically 0.001 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive MSE shift indicates wavelength increase due to Stark effect, following standard atomic physics and spectroscopy conventions.
