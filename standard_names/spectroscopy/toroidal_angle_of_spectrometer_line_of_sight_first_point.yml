name: toroidal_angle_of_spectrometer_line_of_sight_first_point
description: Toroidal angle (φ coordinate) of the first point defining the spectrometer
  line of sight.
documentation: 'Toroidal angle coordinate φ of the first endpoint of the spectrometer
  diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates (R, φ, Z). Convention: φ is
  oriented counter-clockwise when viewing from above (looking down the negative Z-axis),
  with φ = 0 typically at the machine reference position. Together with R and Z coordinates,
  defines the 3D position of the line of sight starting point.'
