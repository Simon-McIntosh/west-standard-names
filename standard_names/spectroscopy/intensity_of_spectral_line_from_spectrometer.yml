name: intensity_of_spectral_line_from_spectrometer
description: Uncalibrated intensity of an identified spectral line integrated over
  its wavelength range.
documentation: "Uncalibrated intensity of a specific spectral line, integrated over\
  \ the wavelength extent of the line. Represents the total photoelectron count rate\
  \ for the line after background subtraction but before absolute radiometric calibration.\
  \ Units: counts per second (s\u207B\xB9). Useful for qualitative monitoring of line\
  \ emission trends and relative intensity comparisons when absolute calibration is\
  \ not required or available."
