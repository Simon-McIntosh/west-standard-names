name: toroidal_angle_of_line_of_sight_second_point_from_spectrometer
description: "Toroidal angle (\u03C6 coordinate) of the second point defining the\
  \ spectrometer line of sight."
documentation: "Toroidal angle coordinate \u03C6 of the second endpoint of the spectrometer\
  \ diagnostic line of sight. Convention: \u03C6 oriented counter-clockwise when viewing\
  \ from above. For tangential views, the difference between first and second point\
  \ toroidal angles determines the viewing geometry relative to magnetic field lines."
