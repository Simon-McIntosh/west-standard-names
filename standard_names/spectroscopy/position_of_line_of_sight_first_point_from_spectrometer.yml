description: 3D position vector of the first point defining the spectrometer line
  of sight.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, \u03C6, Z) of the first endpoint\
  \ defining the spectrometer diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates.\
  \ R is the major radius, \u03C6 is the toroidal angle (rad), and Z is the height.\
  \ This vector, together with the second point vector, completely defines the viewing\
  \ chord geometry through the plasma for line-integrated spectroscopic measurements."
