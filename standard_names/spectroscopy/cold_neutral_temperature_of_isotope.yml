name: cold_neutral_temperature_of_isotope
description: Temperature characterizing the cold neutral population for a specific
  isotope.
documentation: Temperature characterizing the energy distribution of the cold neutral
  population for a specific isotope, typically <1 eV. Determined from Doppler broadening
  analysis of spectral lines, where the line width $\Delta\lambda$ relates to temperature
  as $\Delta\lambda / \lambda = \sqrt{2kT/mc^2}$, with $m$ the neutral mass and $c$
  the speed of light. Cold neutrals originate primarily from molecular dissociation
  and wall recycling processes. Temperature values typically 0.1-1 eV in edge and
  divertor regions.
