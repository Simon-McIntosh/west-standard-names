description: Temperature characterizing the cold neutral population for a specific
  isotope.
documentation: |-
  Temperature $T_{cold}$ characterizing the energy distribution of the cold neutral population for a specific isotope, typically <1 eV representing low-energy neutral atoms in fusion plasmas. Determined from Doppler broadening analysis of spectral lines, where the line width $\Delta\lambda$ relates to temperature as $\Delta\lambda / \lambda = \sqrt{2kT/mc^2}$, with $m$ the neutral mass and $c$ the speed of light. Cold neutrals originate primarily from molecular dissociation and wall recycling processes in edge and divertor regions.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta\lambda_{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2\ln 2} \frac{\lambda_0}{c} \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}$$

  where $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$ is full width at half maximum, $\lambda_0$ is rest wavelength, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature, $m$ is neutral mass, and $c$ is speed of light.

  Physical significance: Cold neutral temperature determines edge plasma recycling and [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) physics in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [scrape_off_layer](#scrape_off_layer) and [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) in edge regions. Strongly coupled to [edge_pedestal](#edge_pedestal) physics and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through recycling effects. Essential for modeling neutral transport and impurity behavior in edge plasma scenarios.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) measures narrow spectral line components for cold neutral analysis. High-resolution spectrometers resolve Doppler broadening. Edge plasma modeling codes calculate cold neutral production rates. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides edge plasma parameters for neutral transport analysis. Spectroscopic analysis determines temperature from line profile fitting.

  Typical values: ITER: Cold neutral temperatures 0.1-1 eV in edge and divertor regions. JET: 0.05-0.8 eV for standard operations. DIII-D: 0.1-0.5 eV depending on recycling conditions. Lower temperatures in regions with strong wall recycling.

  Sign convention: Positive temperature indicates thermal energy of cold neutral population, with narrow line components indicating low-energy neutral atoms from recycling processes.
