name: atomic_mass_number_of_isotope
description: Atomic mass number (A) of an isotope or element in atomic mass units.
documentation: 'Atomic mass number A of an isotope, representing the total number
  of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, expressed in unified atomic mass units (u).
  For hydrogen isotopes: $A_H = 1$, $A_D = 2$, $A_T = 3$. For helium isotopes: $A_{^3He}
  = 3$, $A_{^4He} = 4$. Used to identify isotopes in spectroscopic measurements and
  calculate mass-dependent properties like gyroradius and neutral penetration depth.
  Combined with nuclear charge number Z determines the isotope uniquely.'
