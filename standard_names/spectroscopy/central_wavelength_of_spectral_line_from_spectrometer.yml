name: central_wavelength_of_spectral_line_from_spectrometer
description: Central wavelength of an identified spectral line after processing.
documentation: Central wavelength of a processed spectral line identified in the measured
  spectrum. Determined by fitting the line profile (typically Gaussian or Voigt) to
  the measured intensity distribution. The central wavelength can be used to identify
  atomic/ionic species and measure Doppler shifts for velocity and temperature diagnostics.
  Wavelength shifts from the rest wavelength indicate plasma motion or thermal broadening
  effects.
