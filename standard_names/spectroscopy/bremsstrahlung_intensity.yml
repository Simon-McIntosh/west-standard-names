description: Bremsstrahlung radiation intensity measurement.
documentation: |-
  Bremsstrahlung radiation intensity $I_{brem}$ measurement, representing the continuum radiation from electron-ion collisions. Bremsstrahlung provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through continuum emission.

  $$I_{brem} = \int n_e n_i Z_i^2 \sqrt{T_e} \exp\left(-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T_e}\right) \, d\nu$$

  where $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density), $n_i$ is ion density, $Z_i$ is atomic number, $T_e$ is [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), and $h\nu$ is photon energy.

  Physical significance:

  Bremsstrahlung intensity provides information about [electron_density](#electron_density) and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) through continuum radiation analysis. Bremsstrahlung complement line emission with information about total plasma emission. Spectroscopy measure total radiation for [radiation_diagnostics](#radiation_diagnostics) analysis. See [electron_density](#electron_density) for density relationships and [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) for temperature effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Bremsstrahlung relates to plasma parameters:

  $$I_{brem} \propto n_e n_i Z_i^2 T_e^{-1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T_e}\right)$$

  where the exponential cutoff depends on temperature.

  Measurement methods:

  Bremsstrahlung is measured using broadband spectrometers covering visible to X-ray ranges. Continuum background is separated from line emission. Absolute calibration uses known radiation sources. Multiple wavelengths provide temperature information. Time-resolved measurements study radiation dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected bremsstrahlung intensities of 10^15-10^18 W/sr for typical plasma parameters. JET: Typical intensities 10^13-10^16 W/sr for standard operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^12-10^15 W/sr depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5%.

  Sign convention: Positive bremsstrahlung intensity indicates measured power from continuum radiation, following standard radiometry and spectroscopy conventions.
