description: Charge exchange recombination spectrum measurement.
documentation: |-
  Charge exchange recombination spectrum $S_{CX}$ measurement, representing the emission from neutral beam-induced charge exchange reactions. CXRS provides information about [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [ion_density](#ion_density) profiles.

  $$S_{CX}(\lambda) = \sum_i n_i n_0 \langle \sigma v \rangle_{CX} \frac{hc}{\lambda} \exp\left(-\frac{E(\lambda)}{k_B T_i}\right)$$

  where $n_i$ is ion density, $n_0$ is neutral density, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{CX}$ is charge exchange rate coefficient, and $T_i$ is [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature).

  Physical significance:

  Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy provides direct measurement of [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [ion_density](#ion_density) through Doppler broadening and absolute intensities. CXRS is sensitive to hydrogenic ions and provides core plasma information. Spectroscopy complement [thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) with ion species data. See [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) for temperature relationships and [ion_density](#ion_density) for density effects.

  Measurement relation:

  CX spectrum relates to ion temperature and density:

  $$\Delta \lambda_{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2\ln 2} \frac{\lambda_0}{c} \sqrt{\frac{2k_B T_i}{m_i}}$$

  where $m_i$ is ion mass and $\lambda_0$ is rest wavelength.

  Measurement methods:

  CXRS uses neutral beam injection to create charge exchange reactions. High-resolution spectrometers measure Doppler-broadened spectral lines. Multiple viewing chords provide radial profiles. Background subtraction removes other emission sources. Time-resolved measurements study transport dynamics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected CXRS intensities of 10^14-10^17 W/sr for hydrogenic lines. JET: Typical intensities 10^12-10^15 W/sr for standard operations. DIII-D: Intensity ranges 10^11-10^14 W/sr depending on beam power. Spectral resolution typically 0.01 nm.

  Sign convention: Positive CXRS intensity indicates measured power from charge exchange reactions, following standard spectroscopy conventions and atomic physics principles.
