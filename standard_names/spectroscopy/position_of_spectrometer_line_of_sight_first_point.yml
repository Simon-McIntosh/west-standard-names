description: Position vector of the first point defining the spectrometer line of
  sight.
documentation: Three-dimensional position vector (R, φ, Z) of the first endpoint defining
  the spectrometer diagnostic line of sight in cylindrical coordinates. R is the major
  radius, φ is the toroidal angle (rad), and Z is the height. This vector, together
  with the second point vector, completely defines the viewing chord geometry through
  the plasma for line-integrated spectroscopic measurements.
