description: Fraction of hot neutrals relative to total neutrals for a specific isotope.
documentation: Fraction of hot neutrals relative to the total neutral population for
  a specific isotope, defined as $f_{hot} = n_{hot} / (n_{cold} + n_{hot})$. Dimensionless
  quantity between 0 and 1, where $f_{hot} + f_{cold} = 1$. Hot neutrals are produced
  by charge exchange between plasma ions and background neutrals, carrying energies
  comparable to ion temperature (typically tens of eV to keV). Extracted from spectral
  line shape analysis using multi-Gaussian fits to separate cold and hot components.
