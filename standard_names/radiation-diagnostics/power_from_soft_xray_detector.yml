description: Total radiant power received by soft X-ray detector.
documentation: "Total radiant power received by the soft X-ray detector in a specific\
  \ energy band. This is the raw or calibrated signal proportional to the photon flux\
  \ integrated over the detector area and acceptance solid angle. Power is related\
  \ to brightness by: $P = B \\cdot G$ where $B$ is brightness and $G$ is the detector's\
  \ \xE9tendue. For absolute measurements, proper calibration accounts for detector\
  \ efficiency, filter transmission, and electronic gain. Power signals are used for\
  \ MHD activity monitoring, radiation loss estimates, and tomographic reconstruction\
  \ after normalization by \xE9tendue."
