description: Three-dimensional position vector of second point defining soft X-ray
  detector line of sight.
documentation: |-
  Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, φ) of the second geometric point defining a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical coordinates. Components are:
  - radial_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_second_point
  - vertical_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_second_point
  - toroidal_angle_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_second_point

  The line segment connecting first and second position vectors defines the viewing chord through the plasma. For pinhole systems, this represents the pinhole location. Note: toroidal_angle has units of radians while the vector unit is meters for (R, Z) components.
