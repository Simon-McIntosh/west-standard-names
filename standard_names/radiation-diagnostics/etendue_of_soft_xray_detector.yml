description: Geometric extent (étendue) of soft X-ray detector optical system.
documentation: 'Étendue (geometric extent) of the soft X-ray detector''s optical system,
  defined as the product of the effective collection area and solid angle: $G = A
  \Omega$ where $A$ is the detector area and $\Omega$ is the solid angle of acceptance.
  The étendue characterizes the light-gathering power of the optical system and is
  an important calibration parameter for converting measured signals to absolute brightness
  values. Units are m²·sr. Larger étendue improves signal-to-noise ratio but reduces
  spatial resolution. For pinhole-based systems, $G \approx A_{detector} A_{pinhole}/d^2$
  where $d$ is the pinhole-to-detector distance.'
