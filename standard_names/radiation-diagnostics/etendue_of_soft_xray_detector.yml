description: "Geometric extent (\xE9tendue) of soft X-ray detector optical system."
documentation: "\xC9tendue (geometric extent) of the soft X-ray detector's optical\
  \ system, defined as the product of the effective collection area and solid angle:\
  \ $G = A \\Omega$ where $A$ is the detector area and $\\Omega$ is the solid angle\
  \ of acceptance. The \xE9tendue characterizes the light-gathering power of the optical\
  \ system and is an important calibration parameter for converting measured signals\
  \ to absolute brightness values. Units are m\xB2\xB7sr. Larger \xE9tendue improves\
  \ signal-to-noise ratio but reduces spatial resolution. For pinhole-based systems,\
  \ $G \\approx A_{detector} A_{pinhole}/d^2$ where $d$ is the pinhole-to-detector\
  \ distance."
