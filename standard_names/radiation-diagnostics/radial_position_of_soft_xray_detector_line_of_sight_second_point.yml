description: Major radius (R coordinate) of second point defining soft X-ray detector
  line of sight.
documentation: "Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the second geometric point defining\
  \ a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, \u03C6) coordinates.\
  \ The line segment connecting the first and second points defines the viewing chord\
  \ through the plasma. For pinhole camera systems, this typically represents the\
  \ pinhole location. The chord geometry determines which plasma regions contribute\
  \ to the measured signal."
