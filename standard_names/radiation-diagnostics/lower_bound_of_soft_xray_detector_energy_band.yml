name: lower_bound_of_soft_xray_detector_energy_band
description: Lower energy threshold of soft X-ray detector sensitive energy band.
documentation: Lower energy boundary of the soft X-ray detector's sensitive energy
  band. Soft X-rays typically span ~0.1-20 keV photon energies, corresponding to plasma
  temperatures and impurity line emission in the soft X-ray range. The energy band
  is determined by detector material properties (e.g., Si, GaAs), filters (Be, Al
  foils), and photon absorption characteristics. Multiple energy bands allow spectroscopic
  analysis and separation of different radiation contributions (bremsstrahlung, line
  emission).
