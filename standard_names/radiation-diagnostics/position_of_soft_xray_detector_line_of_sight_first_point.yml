description: Three-dimensional position vector of first point defining soft X-ray
  detector line of sight.
documentation: |-
  Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, φ) of the first geometric point defining a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical coordinates. Components are:
  - radial_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point
  - vertical_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point
  - toroidal_angle_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point

  This vector typically represents the detector location for tomographic systems. Note: toroidal_angle has units of radians while the vector unit is meters for (R, Z) components.
