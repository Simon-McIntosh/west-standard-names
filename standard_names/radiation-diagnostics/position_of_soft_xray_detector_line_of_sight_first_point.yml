description: Three-dimensional position vector of first point defining soft X-ray
  detector line of sight.
documentation: "Three-dimensional position vector (R, Z, \u03C6) of the first geometric\
  \ point defining a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical coordinates.\
  \ Components are:\n- radial_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point\n\
  - vertical_position_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point\n- toroidal_angle_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_first_point\n\
  \nThis vector typically represents the detector location for tomographic systems.\
  \ Note: toroidal_angle has units of radians while the vector unit is meters for\
  \ (R, Z) components."
