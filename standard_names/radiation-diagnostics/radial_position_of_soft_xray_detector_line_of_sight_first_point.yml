description: Major radius (R coordinate) of first point defining soft X-ray detector
  line of sight.
documentation: "Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the first geometric point defining\
  \ a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, \u03C6) coordinates.\
  \ For tomographic reconstruction systems, this typically represents the detector\
  \ location. The line connecting first and second points defines the viewing chord\
  \ through the plasma used for line-integrated soft X-ray emissivity measurements.\
  \ Accurate positioning is critical for tomographic inversion and plasma shape reconstruction."
