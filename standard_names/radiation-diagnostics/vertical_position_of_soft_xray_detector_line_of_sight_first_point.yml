description: Height (Z coordinate) of first point defining soft X-ray detector line
  of sight.
documentation: Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the first geometric point defining
  a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, φ) coordinates. The Z
  coordinate is measured from the machine midplane, with positive values above and
  negative values below. This vertical position, combined with R and φ, fully specifies
  the detector location in 3D space for tomographic reconstruction algorithms.
