name: toroidal_angle_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_second_point
description: Toroidal angle (φ coordinate) of second point defining soft X-ray detector
  line of sight.
documentation: Toroidal angle φ of the second geometric point defining a soft X-ray
  detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, φ) coordinates. Measured counter-clockwise
  when viewing from above. The difference between first and second point toroidal
  angles determines the toroidal extent of the viewing chord, which is typically small
  for localized measurements but may be significant for tangential viewing geometries.
