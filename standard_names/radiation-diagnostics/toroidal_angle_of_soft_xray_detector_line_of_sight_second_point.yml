name: toroidal_angle_of_soft_xray_detector_line_of_sight_second_point
description: "Toroidal angle (\u03C6 coordinate) of second point defining soft X-ray\
  \ detector line of sight."
documentation: "Toroidal angle \u03C6 of the second geometric point defining a soft\
  \ X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, \u03C6) coordinates. Measured\
  \ counter-clockwise when viewing from above. The difference between first and second\
  \ point toroidal angles determines the toroidal extent of the viewing chord, which\
  \ is typically small for localized measurements but may be significant for tangential\
  \ viewing geometries."
