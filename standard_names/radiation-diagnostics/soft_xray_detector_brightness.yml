description: Brightness signal output from soft X-ray detector (specific intensity
  per unit area per unit solid angle).
documentation: 'Brightness (specific intensity) measured by the soft X-ray detector,
  defined as the power flux per unit solid angle per unit area: $B = P / (A \Omega)$
  where $P$ is power, $A$ is detector area, and $\Omega$ is solid angle. This is the
  étendue-normalized signal, obtained by dividing the measured power by the detector''s
  étendue. Brightness is the fundamental radiometric quantity for tomographic reconstruction,
  as it is independent of the detector''s geometric parameters. Units are W·m⁻²·sr⁻¹.
  The brightness is related to plasma emissivity through line integration along the
  viewing chord.'
