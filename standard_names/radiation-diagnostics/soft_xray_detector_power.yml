name: soft_xray_detector_power
description: Power signal output from soft X-ray detector.
documentation: |-
  Total radiant power received by the soft X-ray detector in a specific energy band. This is the raw or calibrated signal proportional to the photon flux integrated over the detector area and acceptance solid angle. Power is related to brightness by: $P = B \cdot G$ where $B$ is brightness and $G$ is the detector's étendue. For absolute measurements, proper calibration accounts for detector efficiency, filter transmission, and electronic gain. Power signals are used for MHD activity monitoring, radiation loss estimates, and tomographic reconstruction after normalization by étendue.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{detected} = \int_{E_{min}}^{E_{max}} \int_{\lambda} \eta_{detector}(E) \cdot T_{filter}(E) \cdot \Phi_{photon}(E,\lambda) \cdot A_{effective} \, d\lambda \, dE$$

  where $\eta_{detector}$ is detector efficiency, $T_{filter}$ is filter transmission, $\Phi_{photon}$ is photon flux, and $A_{effective}$ is effective detector area.

  Physical significance: This quantity provides direct measurement of [soft_xray_emission](#soft_xray_emission) from [plasma_radiation](#plasma_radiation) processes, enabling [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) monitoring and [radiation_analysis](#radiation_analysis). Power measurements are essential for [energy_balance](#energy_balance) studies and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) assessment. Critical for [impurity_radiation](#impurity_radiation) characterization and [disruption_prediction](#disruption_prediction). Strongly coupled to [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature), [plasma_density](#plasma_density), and [radiative_losses](#radiative_losses). Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [plasma_control](#plasma_control) systems.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Semiconductor_detectors](#semiconductor_detectors) measure X-ray photon flux with high sensitivity. [Scintillation_detectors](#scintillation_detectors) provide time-resolved measurements for dynamic studies. [Electronic_amplification](#electronic_amplification) systems process weak signals for detection. [Energy_discrimination](#energy_discrimination) enables spectral analysis of different radiation components. [Absolute_calibration](#absolute_calibration) uses known X-ray sources for radiometric accuracy.

  Typical values: ITER: Expected power levels 10⁻⁶-10⁻² W depending on plasma emission and detector configuration. JET: Typical powers 10⁻⁷-10⁻³ W for standard operations. DIII-D: Power ranges 10⁻⁸-10⁻⁴ W depending on plasma conditions. Signal-to-noise ratio typically 10:1 to 1000:1 for calibrated systems.

  Sign convention: Positive power indicates radiant energy flow per unit time detected by the measurement system, with higher values corresponding to stronger soft X-ray emission from plasma processes.
