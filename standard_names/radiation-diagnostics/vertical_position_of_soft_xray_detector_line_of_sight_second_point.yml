description: Height (Z coordinate) of second point defining soft X-ray detector line
  of sight.
documentation: "Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the second geometric point defining\
  \ a soft X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, \u03C6) coordinates.\
  \ Together with the first point's Z coordinate, this determines the vertical viewing\
  \ angle and which plasma regions (core, edge, divertor) are observed along the line\
  \ of sight. Vertical positioning is crucial for distinguishing between core and\
  \ edge emissivity contributions."
