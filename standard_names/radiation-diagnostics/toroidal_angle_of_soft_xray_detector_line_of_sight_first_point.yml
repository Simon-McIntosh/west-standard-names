description: "Toroidal angle (\u03C6 coordinate) of first point defining soft X-ray\
  \ detector line of sight."
documentation: "Toroidal angle \u03C6 of the first geometric point defining a soft\
  \ X-ray detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, \u03C6) coordinates. The angle\
  \ is measured counter-clockwise when viewing from above, with \u03C6 = 0 typically\
  \ aligned with a reference toroidal location. Together with R and Z coordinates,\
  \ this defines the spatial location of the detector or first measurement point.\
  \ Used in tomographic reconstruction to account for toroidal variations in emissivity."
