description: Toroidal angle (φ coordinate) of first point defining soft X-ray detector
  line of sight.
documentation: Toroidal angle φ of the first geometric point defining a soft X-ray
  detector line of sight in cylindrical (R, Z, φ) coordinates. The angle is measured
  counter-clockwise when viewing from above, with φ = 0 typically aligned with a reference
  toroidal location. Together with R and Z coordinates, this defines the spatial location
  of the detector or first measurement point. Used in tomographic reconstruction to
  account for toroidal variations in emissivity.
