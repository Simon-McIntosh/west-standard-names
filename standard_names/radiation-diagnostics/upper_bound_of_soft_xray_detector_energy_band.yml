name: upper_bound_of_soft_xray_detector_energy_band
description: Upper energy threshold of soft X-ray detector sensitive energy band.
documentation: 'Upper energy boundary of the soft X-ray detector''s sensitive energy
  band. The upper limit defines the maximum photon energy to which the detector is
  sensitive, typically determined by material photoelectric absorption cross-sections
  and detector thickness. For tomographic reconstruction, multiple overlapping energy
  bands provide temperature and impurity density profile information. Typical upper
  bounds: 5-20 keV for core plasma diagnostics.'
