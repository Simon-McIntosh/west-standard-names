description: Major radius (R coordinate) of toroidal field probe center in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the geometric center of a toroidal magnetic field probe coil. Together with vertical position ($Z$) and toroidal angle ($\phi$), defines the $(R, Z, \phi)$ position of the probe in cylindrical coordinates.

  Toroidal field probes measure field components along their sensor normal direction and are used to detect variations in the toroidal field due to coil ripple, ferritic inserts, or error fields.
