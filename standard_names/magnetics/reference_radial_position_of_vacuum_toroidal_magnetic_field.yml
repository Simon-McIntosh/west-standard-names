name: reference_radial_position_of_vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field
description: Reference major radius where vacuum toroidal magnetic field is specified.
documentation: Reference major radius $R_0$ where the vacuum toroidal magnetic field
  $B_0$ is defined. Typically chosen at the machine geometric center or vessel midplane.
  Together with `toroidal_component_of_vacuum_magnetic_field_at_reference_position`,
  defines the vacuum toroidal field profile $B_{tor}(R) \approx B_0 R_0 / R$ for equilibrium
  calculations and flux coordinate normalization.
