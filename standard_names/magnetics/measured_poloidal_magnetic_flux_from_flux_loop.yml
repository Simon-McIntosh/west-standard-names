name: measured_poloidal_magnetic_flux_from_flux_loop
description: Measured poloidal magnetic flux from flux loop used in reconstruction.
documentation: Poloidal magnetic flux $\Phi_p$ measured by flux loop diagnostic, used
  as constraint in equilibrium reconstruction. Flux defined as $\Phi_p = \int \mathbf{B}_p
  \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ over loop area. **Sign convention:** Positive when normal to
  loop points downward (negative $Z$ direction). Fundamental measurement for equilibrium
  reconstruction and plasma current estimation.
