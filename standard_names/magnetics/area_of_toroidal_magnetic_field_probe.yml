description: Effective sensing area of a single turn of toroidal field probe coil.
documentation: |-
  Cross-sectional area $A$ of each turn in the toroidal magnetic field probe sensor coil. The total effective sensing area is $N A$ where $N$ is the number of turns.

  Relates measured voltage to field changes via Faraday's law:

  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$

  where $B_n$ is the field component along the sensor normal. Essential for calibration and quantitative field measurements.
