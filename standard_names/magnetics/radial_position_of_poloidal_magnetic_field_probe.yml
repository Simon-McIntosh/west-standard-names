description: Major radius (R coordinate) of poloidal field probe center in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the geometric center of a poloidal magnetic field probe coil. Together with vertical position ($Z$) and toroidal angle ($\phi$), defines the $(R, Z, \phi)$ position of the probe in cylindrical coordinates.

  The probe measures the magnetic field component along its sensor normal axis direction. Accurate positioning is essential for interpreting the field measurements and for plasma equilibrium reconstruction using multiple probe arrays.
