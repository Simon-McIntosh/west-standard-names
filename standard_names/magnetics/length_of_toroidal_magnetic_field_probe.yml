name: length_of_toroidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Length of sensing coil along sensor normal axis of toroidal field probe.
documentation: 'Physical length $L$ of the sensor coil along its normal axis direction.
  Defines the spatial extent over which the magnetic field is averaged.


  The measured field is a volume average over the sensing region of volume $V = N
  A L$, where $N$ is the number of turns and $A$ is the area per turn.'
