description: Voltage induced across terminals of poloidal field probe coil.
documentation: 'Voltage $V$ induced across the terminals of a poloidal magnetic field
  probe coil due to time-varying magnetic flux. Related to the time derivative of
  magnetic field by Faraday''s law:


  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$


  where $N$ is the number of turns, $A$ is the area per turn, and $B_n$ is the magnetic
  field component along the sensor normal axis.


  The voltage signal is typically integrated to obtain the magnetic field:


  $$B_n(t) = B_n(t_0) - \frac{1}{NA} \int_{t_0}^{t} V(t'') dt''$$


  Direct voltage measurements are useful for fast timescale phenomena and for diagnosing
  sensor functionality.'
