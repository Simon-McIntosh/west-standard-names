name: poloidal_magnetic_flux_from_flux_loop
description: Poloidal magnetic flux measured by flux loop diagnostic.
documentation: 'Poloidal magnetic flux threading through a flux loop coil, defined
  as the surface integral of the poloidal magnetic field:


  $$\Phi_p = \int \mathbf{B}_p \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$


  where the integration is over the area enclosed by the loop.


  **Sign convention:** Positive flux when the normal vector to the loop area points
  downward (negative $Z$ direction), following right-hand rule with respect to the
  toroidal direction.


  By Faraday''s law, the induced voltage in the loop is:


  $$V_{induced} = -\frac{d\Phi_p}{dt}$$


  Flux loop measurements are fundamental for equilibrium reconstruction, plasma current
  estimation, and real-time plasma position control. Partial flux loops can also be
  used, with appropriate geometric corrections for the unclosed contour.'
