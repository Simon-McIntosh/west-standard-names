description: Change in magnetic flux measured by diamagnetic loop.
documentation: |-
  Change in magnetic flux $\Delta \Phi$ measured by diamagnetic loop diagnostic, representing the difference between vacuum and plasma magnetic fields. Diamagnetic loops measure the diamagnetic effect of plasma pressure on magnetic field lines.

  $$\Delta \Phi = \Phi_{\text{vacuum}} - \Phi_{\text{plasma}} = \mu_0 \int (\mathbf{B}_{\text{vacuum}} - \mathbf{B}_{\text{plasma}}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where the flux change is proportional to plasma [beta](#plasma_beta) and total stored energy.

  Physical significance:

  Diamagnetic flux change relates directly to [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) and total thermal energy content. Higher beta plasmas show stronger diamagnetic effects. The measurement provides global energy confinement assessment and validates [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstructions. See [plasma_thermal_energy](#plasma_thermal_energy) for energy content and [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) for pressure balance.

  Measurement relation:

  Diamagnetic flux change relates to plasma beta:

  $$\Delta \Phi = \beta_p \Phi_{\text{poloidal}}$$

  where $\beta_p$ is poloidal beta and $\Phi_{\text{poloidal}}$ is poloidal flux. The measurement gives direct access to plasma energy content.

  Measurement methods:

  Diamagnetic loops consist of multi-turn coils positioned to measure poloidal magnetic flux. Flux change is measured by comparing vacuum and plasma conditions. Integration of induced voltages gives flux differences. Calibration uses known magnetic fields and reference measurements. Loop geometry and positioning determine measurement sensitivity and accuracy.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected diamagnetic flux changes of 0.1-1 Wb for high-beta plasmas. JET: Typical flux changes 0.01-0.1 Wb during high-performance operation. DIII-D: Flux changes 0.001-0.01 Wb depending on beta and plasma current. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive flux change indicates diamagnetic effect (plasma field weaker than vacuum field), following standard diamagnetic loop measurement conventions.
