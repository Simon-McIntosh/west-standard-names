description: Position vector of toroidal field probe center in cylindrical coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Three-dimensional position vector $(R, Z, \phi)$ defining the geometric center of a toroidal magnetic field probe in cylindrical coordinates. Components are radial position (major radius $R$), vertical position (height $Z$), and toroidal angle ($\phi$).

  The probe measures magnetic field components along its sensor normal axis at this location, typically used to characterize toroidal field ripple and error fields.
