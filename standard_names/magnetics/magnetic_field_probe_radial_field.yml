description: Radial component of magnetic field measured by probe.
documentation: |-
  Radial component $B_R$ of [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measured by magnetic field probe diagnostic, representing the outward-directed magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates. Field probes provide localized measurements of magnetic field vectors for detailed equilibrium analysis.

  $$B_R = \frac{\mu_0 I_p}{2\pi R} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial Z}$$

  where $I_p$ is [plasma_current](#plasma_current), $R$ is major radius, and $\psi$ is poloidal flux.

  Physical significance:

  Radial magnetic field components indicate plasma position and shape deviations from axisymmetry. Field measurements validate [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstructions and detect MHD instabilities. Radial fields affect particle and energy transport. See [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) for field components and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) for stability analysis.

  Measurement relation:

  Radial field relates to flux surface geometry:

  $$B_R = \frac{1}{R} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial Z}$$

  where $\psi$ is poloidal flux. The measurement provides direct access to flux surface gradients.

  Measurement methods:

  Magnetic field probes use small coils positioned at specific locations to measure local magnetic fields. Multiple probe orientations measure vector components. Signal processing extracts DC and AC field variations. Probe calibration uses reference magnetic fields and geometric surveys. Spatial positioning determines measurement accuracy and resolution.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected radial fields of 0.01-0.1 T near plasma boundary, depending on plasma position and current. JET: Typical radial fields 0.001-0.01 T for standard operations. DIII-D: Field ranges 0.0001-0.001 T depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive radial field points outward from the tokamak center (increasing major radius), following cylindrical coordinate conventions and standard magnetic field definitions.
