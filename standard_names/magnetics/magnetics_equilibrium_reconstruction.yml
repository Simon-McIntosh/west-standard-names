description: Quality metric for equilibrium reconstruction from magnetic diagnostics.
documentation: |-
  Magnetics equilibrium reconstruction representing the quality metric for determining plasma equilibrium parameters from magnetic field measurements in magnetized plasmas. This reconstruction technique uses magnetic probe arrays, flux loops, and diamagnetic measurements to infer plasma shape, position, and internal parameters. The reconstruction quality indicates the accuracy and reliability of the equilibrium analysis in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\nabla p = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$$

  where $\nabla p$ is pressure gradient, $\mathbf{J}$ is current density, and $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field.

  Physical significance: Magnetics equilibrium reconstruction determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through equilibrium analysis and directly affects [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) control. Critical for understanding [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and plasma shape control in tokamak operation. Strongly coupled to [magnetics](#magnetics) diagnostics, [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium), and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) through reconstruction algorithms. Essential for [equilibrium-reconstruction](#equilibrium-reconstruction) and plasma control systems.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Magnetic probe arrays measure magnetic fields with high precision. [Magnetics](#magnetics) analysis determines plasma shape and position from field measurements. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction codes calculate equilibrium parameters. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses reconstructed data for stability studies. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) control.

  Typical values: ITER: Reconstruction quality 0.8-0.95 (dimensionless) for position accuracy 1-2 cm. JET: 0.85-0.98 for accuracy 0.5-1 cm. DIII-D: 0.9-0.99 with high temporal resolution. Quality metrics typically 0-1 scale where 1 represents perfect reconstruction. Range across machines: 0.8-0.99.

  Sign convention: Positive when reconstruction quality indicates reliable equilibrium state determination with standard tokamak geometry conventions.
