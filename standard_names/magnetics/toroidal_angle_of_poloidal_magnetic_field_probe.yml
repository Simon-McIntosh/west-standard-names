description: Toroidal angle (φ coordinate) of poloidal field probe center in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Toroidal angle $\phi$ specifying the azimuthal position of a poloidal magnetic field probe center in cylindrical coordinates. The angle is measured counter-clockwise when viewing from above, with $\phi = 0$ typically defined at a machine-specific reference location.

  Together with radial position ($R$) and vertical position ($Z$), this forms the complete $(R, Z, \phi)$ position triplet. Multiple probes distributed toroidally enable assessment of toroidal field asymmetries and plasma shape variations.
