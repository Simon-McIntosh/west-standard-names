description: Position vector of poloidal field probe center in cylindrical coordinates.
documentation: 'Three-dimensional position vector $(R, Z, \phi)$ defining the geometric
  center of a poloidal magnetic field probe in cylindrical coordinates. Components
  are radial position (major radius $R$), vertical position (height $Z$), and toroidal
  angle ($\phi$).


  The probe measures magnetic field components along its sensor normal axis at this
  location. Arrays of probes at different positions enable real-time plasma position
  control and detailed equilibrium reconstruction.'
