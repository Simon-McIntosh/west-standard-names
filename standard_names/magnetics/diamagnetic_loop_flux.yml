description: Diamagnetic flux measured by diamagnetic loop diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Diamagnetic flux $\Phi_{dia}$ measured by a diamagnetic loop encircling the plasma. This quantity is directly related to the plasma stored energy through the reduction in poloidal flux linkage due to plasma pressure (diamagnetic effect).

  For a large-aspect-ratio circular plasma, the diamagnetic flux is approximately proportional to the thermal stored energy:

  $$\Phi_{dia} \approx -\mu_0 R_0 \int p \, dV$$

  where $\Phi_{dia}$ is the diamagnetic flux, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $R_0$ is the major radius, $p$ is the plasma pressure, and the integral is over the plasma volume $V$.

  Diamagnetic loops are toroidally symmetric coils that measure the difference in poloidal flux with and without plasma. Used for real-time stored energy monitoring and plasma control. The diamagnetic flux is related to poloidal beta and can be used to infer thermal energy content.
