description: Magnetic field component measured by toroidal field probe along sensor
  normal axis.
documentation: 'Magnetic field component $B_n = \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ measured
  along the sensor normal axis direction, averaged over the probe sensing volume.


  Obtained by integrating the measured voltage:


  $$B_n(t) = B_n(t_0) - \frac{1}{NA} \int_{t_0}^{t} V(t'') dt''$$


  where $N$ is the number of turns, $A$ is the area per turn, and $V$ is the measured
  voltage.


  Toroidal field probes are used to measure toroidal field ripple, error fields, and
  field variations due to ferritic inserts or asymmetries in the toroidal field coil
  system.'
