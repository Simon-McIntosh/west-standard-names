description: Vertical component of magnetic field measured by probe.
documentation: |-
  Vertical component $B_Z$ of [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measured by magnetic field probe diagnostic, representing the upward-directed magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates. Field probes provide localized measurements of magnetic field vectors for detailed equilibrium analysis.

  $$B_Z = \frac{\mu_0 I_p}{2\pi} \int \frac{J_{\phi}}{R} \, dR$$

  where $I_p$ is [plasma_current](#plasma_current), $J_{\phi}$ is toroidal current density, and $R$ is major radius.

  Physical significance:

  Vertical magnetic field components are crucial for plasma position control and equilibrium maintenance. Field measurements validate [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstructions and detect vertical instabilities. Vertical fields interact with [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) to define flux surface geometry. See [plasma_position](#plasma_position) for control applications and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) for stability analysis.

  Measurement relation:

  Vertical field relates to current distribution and plasma shape:

  $$B_Z(R,Z) = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi} \int \frac{J_{\phi}(R',Z')}{\sqrt{(R-R')^2 + (Z-Z')^2}} \, dR' dZ'$$

  where the integral is over the current distribution.

  Measurement methods:

  Magnetic field probes use small coils positioned at specific locations to measure local magnetic fields. Multiple probe orientations measure vector components. Signal processing extracts DC and AC field variations. Probe calibration uses reference magnetic fields and geometric surveys. Spatial positioning determines measurement accuracy and resolution.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected vertical fields of 0.1-1 T near control coils, depending on plasma current and position control requirements. JET: Typical vertical fields 0.01-0.1 T for standard operations. DIII-D: Field ranges 0.001-0.01 T depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive vertical field points upward (positive Z direction), following cylindrical coordinate conventions and standard magnetic field definitions.
