description: Magnetic field signal from poloidal field probe along sensor normal axis.
documentation: |-
  Magnetic field component $B_n = \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ measured along the sensor normal axis direction $\mathbf{n}$, averaged over the probe sensing volume.

  The sensor normal direction is defined by poloidal and toroidal orientation angles:

  $$\mathbf{n} = \cos(\theta_n)\cos(\phi_n)\nabla R - \sin(\theta_n)\nabla Z + \cos(\theta_n)\sin(\phi_n)\frac{\nabla\phi}{|\nabla\phi|}$$

  Typically obtained by integrating the measured voltage:

  $$B_n(t) = B_n(t_0) - \frac{1}{NA} \int_{t_0}^{t} V(t') dt'$$

  where $N$ is the number of turns, $A$ is the area per turn, and $V$ is the measured voltage. Used for plasma equilibrium reconstruction and position control.
