description: Voltage induced in saddle loop magnetic diagnostic.
documentation: |-
  Voltage $V_{\text{saddle}}$ induced in saddle loop magnetic diagnostic, representing localized magnetic field measurements. Saddle loops consist of multiple coil segments arranged to measure specific magnetic field components with spatial localization.

  $$V_{\text{saddle}} = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -N \frac{d}{dt} \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where $N$ is the number of turns and $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux through the coil area.

  Physical significance:

  Saddle loop voltages provide localized [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measurements for equilibrium reconstruction and MHD analysis. Voltage signals contain information about field variations and plasma position. Saddle loops complement [flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) measurements with better spatial resolution. See [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) and [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) for field components.

  Measurement relation:

  Saddle loop voltage relates to local magnetic field changes:

  $$V_{\text{saddle}} = -N A \frac{\partial B_{\perp}}{\partial t}$$

  where $B_{\perp}$ is the magnetic field component perpendicular to the coil area $A$.

  Measurement methods:

  Saddle loops use multiple coil segments arranged in saddle configuration around the vacuum vessel. Voltage integration gives magnetic flux changes. Signal processing filters noise and extracts plasma-related variations. Calibration uses known current sources and magnetic field calculations. Spatial positioning determines measurement localization and sensitivity.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected saddle loop voltages of 0.1-10 V during plasma operations, depending on field changes and coil sensitivity. JET: Typical voltages 0.01-1 V for standard plasma operations. DIII-D: Voltage ranges 0.001-0.1 V for typical discharges. Signal bandwidth typically DC to 10 kHz for equilibrium measurements.

  Sign convention: Positive voltage follows Lenz's law (opposes the change in magnetic flux), consistent with electromagnetic induction principles and [flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) conventions.
