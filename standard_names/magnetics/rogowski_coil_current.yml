description: Plasma current measured by Rogowski coil.
documentation: |-
  Plasma current $I_p$ measured by Rogowski coil diagnostic, representing the total toroidal current flowing in the plasma. Rogowski coils are toroidal devices that measure the magnetic field produced by plasma current through electromagnetic induction.

  $$I_p = \frac{1}{\mu_0 N A} \int V_{\text{coil}} \, dt$$

  where $V_{\text{coil}}$ is the induced voltage in the coil, $N$ is the number of turns, $A$ is the coil cross-sectional area, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

  Physical significance:

  Plasma current determines [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) strength through Ampère's law and affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profiles. Current profile shape impacts [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and confinement quality. Bootstrap current and external drive modify the current distribution. See [plasma_current_density](#plasma_current_density) for spatial profiles and [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) for field calculations.

  Measurement relation:

  Rogowski coils measure the line integral of magnetic field around the plasma:

  $$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}$$

  where $I_{\text{enc}}$ is the enclosed current. The coil integrates this magnetic field to give total plasma current.

  Measurement methods:

  Rogowski coils consist of multiple turns wound on a toroidal former surrounding the plasma. Induced voltage is integrated to give current measurements. Calibration uses known current sources and magnetic field calculations. Coil positioning affects measurement accuracy and geometric factors. Integration electronics convert voltage to current with proper scaling factors.

  Typical values:

  ITER: 15 MA plasma current capability, typical operating range 2-15 MA. JET: Up to 5 MA, typical 2-4 MA. DIII-D: Up to 2.5 MA, typical 1-2 MA. Current ramp rates typically 0.1-1 MA/s during plasma initiation and current ramp phases.

  Sign convention: Positive current follows the toroidal direction (counter-clockwise when viewed from above), consistent with [plasma_current](#plasma_current) conventions and [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) right-hand rule.
