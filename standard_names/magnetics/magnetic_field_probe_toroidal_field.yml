description: Toroidal component of magnetic field measured by probe.
documentation: |-
  Toroidal component $B_{\phi}$ of [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measured by magnetic field probe diagnostic, representing the toroidally-directed magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates. Field probes provide localized measurements of magnetic field vectors for detailed equilibrium analysis.

  $$B_{\phi} = \frac{\mu_0 I_{\text{toroidal}}}{2\pi R}$$

  where $I_{\text{toroidal}}$ is the toroidal current and $R$ is major radius.

  Physical significance:

  Toroidal magnetic field provides the primary confinement in tokamaks through magnetic pressure. Field strength determines [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries. Toroidal fields interact with [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) to create helical field lines. See [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) for pressure balance and [safety_factor](#safety_factor) for stability analysis.

  Measurement relation:

  Toroidal field relates to plasma pressure and beta:

  $$\beta = \frac{2\mu_0 p}{B_{\phi}^2}$$

  where $p$ is [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure) and $\beta$ is [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta).

  Measurement methods:

  Magnetic field probes use small coils positioned at specific locations to measure local magnetic fields. Multiple probe orientations measure vector components. Signal processing extracts DC and AC field variations. Probe calibration uses reference magnetic fields and geometric surveys. Spatial positioning determines measurement accuracy and resolution.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected toroidal fields of 5.6 T at R=6.2 m (reference position), with variations ±10% across plasma cross-section. JET: Typical toroidal fields 3.4-4.0 T for high-performance operations. DIII-D: Field ranges 1.7-2.2 T depending on plasma current and coil settings. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive toroidal field follows the toroidal direction (counter-clockwise when viewed from above), consistent with [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) conventions and standard tokamak field definitions.
