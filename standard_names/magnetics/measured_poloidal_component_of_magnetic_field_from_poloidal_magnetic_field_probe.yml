description: Measured poloidal magnetic field from probe used in equilibrium reconstruction.
documentation: 'Poloidal magnetic field component $B_{pol}$ measured by poloidal field
  probe diagnostic, used as constraint in equilibrium reconstruction. Measurement
  is field component along probe sensor normal axis, obtained by integrating induced
  voltage: $B(t) = B(t_0) - \frac{1}{NA} \int_{t_0}^{t} V(t'') dt''$ where $N$ is
  coil turns and $A$ is effective area. Multiple probes provide spatial mapping for
  reconstruction algorithms.'
