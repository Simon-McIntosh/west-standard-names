name: position_of_flux_loop
description: Position vector of flux loop contour point in cylindrical coordinates.
documentation: 'Three-dimensional position vector $(R, Z, \phi)$ defining a point
  on a flux loop contour in cylindrical coordinates. Components are radial position
  (major radius $R$), vertical position (height $Z$), and toroidal angle ($\phi$).


  A complete flux loop is described by a sequence of position vectors defining its
  contour. The loop geometry determines the effective area for poloidal flux measurements
  via Faraday''s law:


  $$V = -\frac{d\psi}{dt}$$


  where $V$ is the induced voltage and $\psi$ is the poloidal magnetic flux enclosed
  by the loop.'
