name: number_of_turns_of_toroidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Number of turns in the sensing coil of toroidal field probe.
documentation: 'Number of wire turns $N$ in the toroidal magnetic field probe coil,
  including sign convention for winding direction.


  The induced voltage is proportional to the number of turns:


  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$


  where $A$ is the area per turn. More turns increase signal strength but may affect
  frequency response due to increased inductance.'
