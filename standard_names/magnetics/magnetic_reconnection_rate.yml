name: magnetic_reconnection_rate
description: Rate of magnetic reconnection events.
documentation: |-
  Rate of magnetic reconnection $\mathcal{R}$ representing the speed and frequency of magnetic field line reconnection events. Reconnection is fundamental to MHD instabilities and energy conversion in fusion plasmas.

  $$\mathcal{R} = \frac{E_{\text{inductive}}}{B L}$$

  where $E_{\text{inductive}}$ is inductive electric field, $B$ is [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) strength, and $L$ is characteristic length scale.

  Physical significance:

  Magnetic reconnection rates determine the timescale of [mhd_instabilities](#mhd_instabilities) and energy release. Fast reconnection can trigger disruptions and affect plasma performance. Reconnection rates are crucial for [tearing_mode](#tearing_mode) stability analysis. See [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) for equilibrium effects and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) for instability coupling.

  Measurement relation:

  Reconnection rate relates to electric field and magnetic field:

  $$\mathcal{R} = \frac{V_{\text{reconnection}}}{B L}$$

  where $V_{\text{reconnection}}$ is reconnection velocity and $L$ is reconnection layer thickness.

  Measurement methods:

  Reconnection rates are inferred from magnetic field measurements during instability events. Electric fields are calculated from magnetic field time derivatives. Analysis uses magnetic probe arrays to measure field changes. Reconnection signatures are identified in magnetic signals. Statistical analysis gives average reconnection rates.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected reconnection rates of 0.01-0.1 during major instabilities, depending on plasma conditions. JET: Typical rates 0.001-0.01 for standard disruptions. DIII-D: Rate ranges 0.0001-0.001 depending on instability type. Measurement precision typically 10% for statistical analysis.

  Sign convention: Positive rate indicates reconnection proceeding in the forward direction (magnetic energy converting to kinetic energy), following standard reconnection physics conventions.
