description: Vacuum toroidal magnetic field component at reference position.
documentation: |-
  Vacuum toroidal magnetic field $B_0$ at the reference major radius $R_0$.

  Sign convention: Positive when anti-clockwise viewing from above (positive toroidal angle direction). The product $R_0 B_0$ characterizes the vacuum field profile $B_{tor}(R) = B_0 R_0 / R$. Used in flux coordinate normalization and equilibrium reconstruction. Must be consistent with actual toroidal field coil currents.
