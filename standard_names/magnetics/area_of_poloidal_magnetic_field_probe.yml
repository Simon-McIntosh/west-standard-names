description: Effective sensing area of a single turn of poloidal field probe coil.
documentation: 'Cross-sectional area $A$ of each turn in the poloidal magnetic field
  probe sensor coil. The total effective sensing area is obtained by multiplying by
  the number of turns $N$.


  This parameter is essential for relating measured voltage to magnetic field changes
  via Faraday''s law:


  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$


  where $B_n$ is the magnetic field component along the sensor normal axis and $t$
  is time. Accurate calibration of the area is critical for quantitative field measurements.'
