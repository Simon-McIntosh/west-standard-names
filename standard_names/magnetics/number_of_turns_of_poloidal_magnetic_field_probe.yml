description: Number of turns in the sensing coil of poloidal field probe.
documentation: 'Number of wire turns $N$ in the poloidal magnetic field probe coil,
  including sign. Negative values can be used to indicate coil winding direction.


  The induced voltage is proportional to the number of turns:


  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$


  where $A$ is the area per turn and $B_n$ is the field component along the sensor
  normal. More turns increase signal amplitude but also increase inductance and may
  reduce frequency response.'
