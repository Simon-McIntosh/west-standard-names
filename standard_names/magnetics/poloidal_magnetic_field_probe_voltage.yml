description: Voltage signal induced in poloidal field probe coil.
documentation: |-
  Voltage $V$ induced across the terminals of a poloidal magnetic field probe coil due to time-varying magnetic flux. Related to the time derivative of magnetic field by Faraday's law:

  $$V = -N A \frac{dB_n}{dt}$$

  where $V$ is the induced voltage, $N$ is the number of turns, $A$ is the area per turn, and $B_n$ is the magnetic field component along the sensor normal axis.

  Direct voltage measurements are useful for fast timescale phenomena and for diagnosing sensor functionality. The voltage signal is typically integrated to obtain the time-varying magnetic field component.
