description: Voltage signal from external magnetic field probe.
documentation: |-
  Voltage signal $V_{\text{probe}}$ from external magnetic field probe diagnostic, representing the induced voltage due to changing magnetic fields. External probes measure magnetic field variations outside the plasma region for equilibrium monitoring and control.

  $$V_{\text{probe}} = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -N \frac{d}{dt} \int \mathbf{B}_{\text{ext}} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where $N$ is number of turns, $\Phi$ is magnetic flux, and $\mathbf{B}_{\text{ext}}$ is external magnetic field.

  Physical significance:

  External probe voltages monitor magnetic field changes for plasma control and equilibrium validation. Voltage signals contain information about plasma current changes and field coil operations. External measurements complement internal diagnostics with robust positioning. See [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field relationships and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) for current coupling.

  Measurement relation:

  Probe voltage relates to magnetic field rate of change:

  $$V_{\text{probe}} = -N A \frac{\partial B_{\perp}}{\partial t}$$

  where $B_{\perp}$ is the magnetic field component perpendicular to probe area.

  Measurement methods:

  External magnetic field probes use coils positioned outside the vacuum vessel to measure magnetic field changes. Voltage signals are amplified and filtered for noise reduction. Signal processing extracts plasma-related variations from background fields. Probe calibration uses reference magnetic fields and geometric surveys. External positioning provides reliable long-term measurements.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected probe voltages of 0.1-10 V during plasma operations, depending on field changes and probe sensitivity. JET: Typical voltages 0.01-1 V for standard plasma operations. DIII-D: Voltage ranges 0.001-0.1 V for typical discharges. Signal bandwidth typically DC to 100 kHz for comprehensive field monitoring.

  Sign convention: Positive voltage follows Lenz's law (opposes the change in magnetic flux), consistent with electromagnetic induction principles and standard probe measurement conventions.
