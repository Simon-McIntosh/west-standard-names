name: reconstructed_poloidal_component_of_magnetic_field_from_poloidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Reconstructed poloidal field from equilibrium solution at probe location.
documentation: Poloidal magnetic field component $B_{pol}$ calculated from reconstructed
  equilibrium at poloidal field probe location. Used to assess goodness-of-fit between
  equilibrium model and diagnostic measurements. Difference between reconstructed
  and measured values indicates reconstruction residuals.
