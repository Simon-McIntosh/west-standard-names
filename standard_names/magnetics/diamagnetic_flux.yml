name: diamagnetic_flux
description: Diamagnetic flux measured by diamagnetic loop diagnostic.
documentation: 'Diamagnetic flux $\Phi_{dia}$ measured by a diamagnetic loop encircling
  the plasma. This quantity is directly related to the plasma stored energy.


  The diamagnetic flux measures the reduction in poloidal flux linkage due to plasma
  pressure (diamagnetic effect). For a large-aspect-ratio circular plasma:


  $$\Phi_{dia} \approx -\mu_0 R_0 \int p \, dV \propto -W_{th}$$


  where $R_0$ is the major radius, $p$ is plasma pressure, and $W_{th}$ is the thermal
  stored energy.


  More generally, the diamagnetic flux is related to the poloidal beta:


  $$\beta_p = \frac{8\pi}{\mu_0} \frac{\langle p \rangle V}{I_p^2} \approx -\frac{2\Phi_{dia}}{\mu_0
  R_0 I_p}$$


  Diamagnetic loops are toroidally symmetric coils that measure the difference in
  poloidal flux with and without plasma. Used for real-time stored energy monitoring
  and plasma control.'
