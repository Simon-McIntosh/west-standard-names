name: reconstructed_poloidal_magnetic_flux_from_flux_loop
description: Reconstructed poloidal flux from equilibrium solution through flux loop.
documentation: Poloidal magnetic flux $\psi$ calculated from reconstructed equilibrium
  by integrating poloidal field over flux loop area. Difference from measured value
  indicates reconstruction residual and solution quality for this diagnostic channel.
