description: Major radius (R coordinate) of flux loop contour point in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) defining the spatial location of a point on a flux loop contour. Together with vertical position ($Z$) and toroidal angle ($\phi$), forms the $(R, Z, \phi)$ triplet describing the flux loop geometry in cylindrical coordinates.

  Multiple position points define the complete flux loop contour used for measuring poloidal magnetic flux. The flux measured by the loop is defined as:

  $$\psi = \int \mathbf{B}_p \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where the integration is over the surface enclosed by the loop. Accurate positioning is critical for equilibrium reconstruction and plasma shape control.
