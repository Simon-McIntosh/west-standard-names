name: length_of_poloidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Length of sensing coil along sensor normal axis of poloidal field probe.
documentation: 'Physical length $L$ of the sensor coil along its normal axis direction.
  This defines the spatial extent over which the magnetic field is averaged.


  The measured field represents a volume average:


  $$B_{measured} = \frac{1}{V} \int_V \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dV$$


  where $V = N A L$ is the total sensing volume ($N$ = number of turns, $A$ = area
  per turn), and $\mathbf{n}$ is the sensor normal direction. Longer sensors provide
  better signal-to-noise but reduce spatial resolution.'
