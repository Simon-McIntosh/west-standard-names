description: Gradient of magnetic field magnitude.
documentation: |-
  Gradient $\nabla |\mathbf{B}|$ of magnetic field magnitude, representing the rate of change of magnetic field strength in space. Field gradients are important for particle motion and MHD stability analysis.

  $$\nabla |\mathbf{B}| = \frac{\partial |\mathbf{B}|}{\partial R} \hat{\mathbf{R}} + \frac{1}{R}\frac{\partial |\mathbf{B}|}{\partial \phi} \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} + \frac{\partial |\mathbf{B}|}{\partial Z} \hat{\mathbf{Z}}$$

  where $|\mathbf{B}|$ is magnetic field magnitude in cylindrical coordinates.

  Physical significance:

  Magnetic field gradients drive particle drifts and affect plasma confinement. Gradients are crucial for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) calculations. Field variations indicate plasma position and shape changes. See [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for base quantities and [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) for pressure effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Field gradient relates to current density and plasma pressure:

  $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

  where $\mathbf{J}$ is current density and $\mathbf{E}$ is electric field.

  Measurement methods:

  Field gradients are calculated from multiple magnetic field probe measurements at different locations. Spatial derivatives are computed using finite difference methods. Probe calibration and positioning determine gradient accuracy. Signal processing filters noise before gradient calculation. Multiple probe configurations optimize spatial resolution.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected field gradients of 0.01-0.1 T/m near plasma boundary, depending on plasma position and current. JET: Typical gradients 0.001-0.01 T/m for standard operations. DIII-D: Gradient ranges 0.0001-0.001 T/m depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive gradient indicates increasing field strength in the direction of the gradient vector, following standard vector calculus conventions.
