name: toroidal_angle_of_sensor_normal_of_toroidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Toroidal angle of sensor normal axis projection of toroidal field probe.
documentation: 'Angle $\phi_n$ of the horizontal projection of the sensor normal axis
  with respect to the direction of increasing major radius $\nabla R$. Measured counter-clockwise
  from above.


  **Convention:** Values taken modulo $\pi$ within $(-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. $\phi_n = 0$
  when the projected sensor normal is parallel to $\nabla R$ (radially outward), $\phi_n
  = \pi/2$ when parallel to $\nabla\phi$ (toroidal direction).


  For toroidal field probes, the sensor normal is often oriented to measure the toroidal
  field component.'
