name: poloidal_angle_of_sensor_normal_of_toroidal_magnetic_field_probe
description: Poloidal angle of sensor normal axis orientation of toroidal field probe.
documentation: 'Angle $\theta_n$ defining the poloidal orientation of the sensor normal
  axis (vector parallel to the coil axis) with respect to the horizontal plane. This
  is a clockwise theta-like angle.


  **Convention:** $\theta_n = 0$ when the sensor normal is fully horizontal and points
  toward increasing major radius. Values range in $[0, 2\pi]$.


  Combined with the toroidal angle of the sensor normal, this fully specifies the
  orientation of the probe and determines which magnetic field component is measured.'
