description: Curvature of magnetic field lines.
documentation: |-
  Curvature $\kappa$ of magnetic field lines, representing the rate of change of field line direction in space. Field line curvature is fundamental to particle motion, MHD stability, and kinetic effects in fusion plasmas.

  $$\kappa = |\frac{d\mathbf{t}}{ds}| = |\mathbf{t} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{t}|$$

  where $\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{B}/|\mathbf{B}|$ is the field line unit tangent vector and $s$ is field line arc length.

  Physical significance:

  Magnetic field line curvature drives [curvature_drift](#curvature_drift) and affects particle confinement. Curvature is crucial for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis, particularly for ballooning modes and interchange instabilities. Curved field lines modify [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) and affect plasma flow patterns. See [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field relationships and [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) for pressure effects.

  Measurement relation:

  Field line curvature relates to magnetic field gradients:

  $$\kappa = \frac{\mathbf{B} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{B})}{|\mathbf{B}|^3}$$

  where the curvature vector points toward the center of curvature.

  Measurement methods:

  Field line curvature is calculated from magnetic field measurements using field line tracing algorithms. Field gradient calculations determine curvature vectors. Multiple magnetic probe configurations provide 3D field measurements. Numerical integration gives field line trajectories and curvature profiles. Analysis includes both local and global curvature characteristics.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected field line curvature of 0.1-1 m^-1 near plasma boundary, depending on plasma shape and magnetic configuration. JET: Typical curvature 0.01-0.1 m^-1 for standard operations. DIII-D: Curvature ranges 0.001-0.01 m^-1 depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5% for local curvature.

  Sign convention: Positive curvature points toward the center of field line curvature, following differential geometry conventions and standard vector analysis definitions.
