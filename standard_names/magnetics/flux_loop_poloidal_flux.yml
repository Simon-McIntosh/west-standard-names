description: Poloidal magnetic flux measured by flux loop.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic flux $\Psi_p$ measured by flux loop diagnostic, representing the magnetic flux linking the plasma in the poloidal direction. Flux loops measure the total poloidal flux for equilibrium reconstruction and plasma control.

  $$\Psi_p = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential and $\mathbf{B}$ is [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field).

  Physical significance:

  Poloidal flux determines [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profiles and defines flux surface geometry. Flux measurements are essential for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and plasma control systems. Flux changes indicate plasma current variations and energy transfer. See [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) for field relationships and [plasma_current](#plasma_current) for current coupling.

  Measurement relation:

  Poloidal flux relates to plasma current and inductance:

  $$\Psi_p = L_p I_p$$

  where $L_p$ is plasma inductance and $I_p$ is [plasma_current](#plasma_current).

  Measurement methods:

  Flux loops consist of multi-turn coils positioned to measure poloidal magnetic flux. Voltage integration gives flux changes over time. Signal processing filters noise and extracts plasma-related variations. Calibration uses known current sources and magnetic field calculations. Loop geometry and positioning determine measurement sensitivity and accuracy.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected poloidal flux of 10-100 Wb for typical plasma operations, depending on plasma current and inductance. JET: Typical flux ranges 1-10 Wb for standard discharges. DIII-D: Flux values 0.1-1 Wb depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 0.1% of full scale.

  Sign convention: Positive poloidal flux follows the right-hand rule for toroidal current (counter-clockwise when viewed from above), consistent with [plasma_current](#plasma_current) conventions and magnetic flux definitions.
