description: Magnetic helicity of plasma magnetic field.
documentation: |-
  Magnetic helicity $\mathcal{H}$ representing the degree of linkage and twist in magnetic field lines. Helicity is a topological invariant that describes the global structure of magnetic fields in fusion plasmas.

  $$\mathcal{H} = \int \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \, dV$$

  where $\mathbf{A}$ is vector potential and $\mathbf{B}$ is [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field).

  Physical significance:

  Magnetic helicity relates to [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) and self-organization in fusion plasmas. Helicity conservation affects magnetic topology and field line evolution. Helicity injection drives current sustainment and plasma formation. See [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field relationships and [magnetic_reconnection_rate](#magnetic_reconnection_rate) for topological changes.

  Measurement relation:

  Helicity relates to magnetic topology and field line linking:

  $$\mathcal{H} = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \, dV$$

  where $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is field line rotation vector.

  Measurement methods:

  Magnetic helicity is calculated from magnetic field measurements and vector potential reconstruction. Field line tracing gives topological information. Volume integrals use magnetic field data from probe arrays. Helicity conservation is monitored during plasma operations. Analysis includes both global and local helicity distributions.

  Typical values:

  ITER: Expected helicity values of 10^6-10^8 Wb^2 depending on plasma current and magnetic configuration. JET: Typical helicity 10^4-10^6 Wb^2 for standard operations. DIII-D: Helicity ranges 10^2-10^4 Wb^2 depending on plasma conditions. Measurement precision typically 5% for global helicity.

  Sign convention: Positive helicity follows right-hand rule for field line linking, consistent with topological definitions and standard magnetic field conventions.
