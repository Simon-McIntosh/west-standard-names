description: Anomalous transport from plasma turbulence and fluctuations exceeding
  neoclassical levels.
documentation: |-
  Turbulent transport representing anomalous transport from plasma turbulence and fluctuations exceeding neoclassical levels in magnetized plasmas. Driven by micro-instabilities including [drift_waves](#drift_waves), [drift_kinetic_theory](#drift_kinetic_theory) effects, and various plasma instabilities. This transport mechanism often dominates neoclassical transport in tokamak core plasma regions, leading to significantly enhanced particle and energy losses. Critical for understanding confinement degradation and transport scaling in fusion devices.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Gamma_{turb} = -D_{turb} \nabla n - \chi_{turb} \nabla T$$

  where $D_{turb}$ and $\chi_{turb}$ are turbulent diffusivities that can be orders of magnitude larger than [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients).

  Physical significance: Turbulent transport determines [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) in most tokamak operating regimes and directly impacts [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance). Strongly coupled to [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [magnetic_shear](#magnetic_shear). Drives [edge_localized_modes](#edge_localized_modes) and affects [h_mode](#h_mode) transition physics. Related to [collisionality](#collisionality) through turbulence drive mechanisms. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization and [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) determines turbulent coefficients from power balance analysis. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides fluctuation measurements for turbulence characterization. [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) measures density fluctuations driving turbulent transport. [Fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) analysis includes turbulent effects on fast ion transport. Gyrokinetic simulations predict turbulent transport levels based on [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) and plasma profiles.

  Typical values: ITER: $D_{turb} \approx 1-10$ m$^2$/s, $\chi_{turb} \approx 5-50$ m$^2$/s. JET: $D_{turb} \approx 0.5-8$ m$^2$/s. DIII-D: $D_{turb} \approx 0.8-12$ m$^2$/s. Turbulent transport typically 10-100x larger than [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients). Range across machines: 0.5-50 m$^2$/s (mean ~8 m$^2$/s).

  Sign convention: Positive coefficients indicate outward transport, consistent with standard transport theory where fluxes are directed away from the magnetic axis toward the plasma boundary.
