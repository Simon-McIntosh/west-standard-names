description: Micro-instabilities in magnetized plasma driving turbulence and anomalous
  transport.
documentation: |-
  Drift waves representing micro-instabilities in magnetized plasma that drive turbulence and anomalous transport through electrostatic and electromagnetic fluctuations. These waves arise from pressure gradients coupled with magnetic field curvature and [drift_kinetic_theory](#drift_kinetic_theory) effects. Critical mechanism for [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) in tokamak core plasma, often dominating [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) by orders of magnitude. Essential for understanding confinement degradation and transport scaling.

  Governing equation:
  $$\omega_* = \frac{k_\perp T_e}{eB} \frac{1}{n_e} \frac{dn_e}{dr}$$

  where $\omega_*$ is the drift wave frequency, $k_\perp$ is perpendicular wavenumber, $T_e$ is electron temperature, $e$ is elementary charge, $B$ is magnetic field strength, $n_e$ is electron density, and $r$ is radial coordinate.

  Physical significance: Drift waves determine [turbulent_transport](#turbulent_transport) levels and directly impact [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance). Strongly coupled to [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta), [safety_factor](#safety_factor), and [magnetic_shear](#magnetic_shear). Drive [edge_localized_modes](#edge_localized_modes) and affect [h_mode](#h_mode) transition physics. Related to [collisionality](#collisionality) through wave-particle interaction mechanisms. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Reflectometry](#reflectometry) measures density fluctuations from drift waves. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides fluctuation spectra for wave analysis. [Fast_ion_physics](#fast_ion_physics) includes drift wave effects on fast ion transport. Gyrokinetic simulations predict drift wave growth rates and saturation levels. [Transport_analysis](#transport_analysis) determines anomalous transport from drift wave turbulence.

  Typical values: ITER: $\omega_* \sim 10^4-10^6$ rad/s, $k_\perp \rho_s \sim 0.1-1.0$. JET: $\omega_* \sim 5\times10^3-5\times10^5$ rad/s. DIII-D: $\omega_* \sim 8\times10^3-8\times10^5$ rad/s. Drift wave frequencies scale with temperature and density gradients. Range across machines: $10^3-10^6$ rad/s (mean ~$10^5$ rad/s).

  Sign convention: Positive frequencies correspond to waves propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction, following standard plasma physics conventions.
