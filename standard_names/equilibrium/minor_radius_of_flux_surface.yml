description: Geometric minor radius of flux surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Geometric minor radius $a_{geo}(\rho) = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$ measuring half-width of flux surface at midplane. This fundamental geometric parameter characterizes the size of flux surfaces in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$a_{geo}(\rho) = \frac{R_{outboard}(\rho) - R_{inboard}(\rho)}{2}$$

  where $R_{outboard}$ and $R_{inboard}$ are the major radius coordinates at the outboard and inboard midplane intersections of the flux surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity increases monotonically from 0 at the magnetic axis to the boundary minor radius $a$ at the plasma edge. Used for normalized radial coordinate $\rho = a_{geo}/a$ and profile parameterization. Differs from flux-based coordinates by geometry effects and is essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The geometric minor radius affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q \propto B_{tor} R_0 / B_{pol} a$ and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through aspect ratio effects. Larger minor radius improves confinement through increased plasma volume but requires stronger magnetic fields for stable operation. Critical for [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits through $\beta \propto a^2 B^2 / R_0$.

  For shaped plasmas with elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$, the geometric minor radius represents the equivalent circular radius that would give the same cross-sectional area. The actual flux surface shape affects transport through geometric factors in [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $a_{geo} \approx 0.1-2.0$ m across plasma radius. JET: $0.05-1.0$ m. DIII-D: $0.03-0.67$ m. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion. Boundary value typically 2.0 m for ITER, 1.0 m for JET, 0.67 m for DIII-D.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric half-width of flux surface at midplane.
