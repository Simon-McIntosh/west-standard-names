description: Poloidal magnetic flux enclosed by flux surface in tokamak.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic flux $\psi$ enclosed by a toroidal flux surface, defined as:

  $$\psi = \int \mathbf{B}_p \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

  where the integral is taken over any poloidal cross-section enclosed by the flux surface and $\mathbf{B}_p$ is the poloidal magnetic field.

  The poloidal flux labels flux surfaces in tokamak equilibria and is a fundamental quantity in MHD equilibrium calculations. It is related to the plasma current distribution through Ampère's law and determines the radial coordinate system in flux coordinates.
