description: Poloidal magnetic flux enclosed by flux surface in tokamak.
documentation: "Poloidal magnetic flux $\\psi$ enclosed by a toroidal flux surface,\
  \ defined as:\n\n$$\\psi = \\int \\mathbf{B}_p \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$$\n\nwhere the\
  \ integral is taken over any poloidal cross-section enclosed by the flux surface\
  \ and $\\mathbf{B}_p$ is the poloidal magnetic field.\n\nThe poloidal flux labels\
  \ flux surfaces in tokamak equilibria and is a fundamental quantity in MHD equilibrium\
  \ calculations. It is related to the plasma current distribution through Amp\xE8\
  re's law and determines the radial coordinate system in flux coordinates."
