description: Magnetic field line length for single poloidal transit.
documentation: |-
  Connection length $L_{conn}(\rho)$ for one complete poloidal circuit following magnetic field line. This fundamental geometric quantity characterizes the distance field lines travel during one poloidal transit in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$L_{conn}(\rho) = \oint_{\text{poloidal}} \frac{B_{\text{tor}}}{B_{pol}} \, dl_{\text{pol}} \approx q(\rho) \cdot 2\pi R_0$$


  where $q(\rho)$ is the safety factor, $B_{tor}$ is toroidal field, $B_{pol}$ is poloidal field, and $R_0$ is major radius.


  Physical significance: This quantity increases with [safety_factor](#safety_factor): $L_{conn} \approx q \cdot 2\pi R_0$. Parallel transport timescale $\tau_{\parallel} = L_{conn}^2 / (2 \chi_{\parallel})$. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Important for impurity transport and parallel heat conduction. Edge connection length affects [scrape_off_layer](#scrape_off_layer) physics and [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics). The connection length affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through parallel transport and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through field line topology.

  Longer connection lengths improve parallel transport but may increase losses to the divertor. The connection length is critical for plasma-wall interaction and affects [particle_confinement_time](#particle_confinement_time) through parallel losses.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using field line tracing and safety factor profiles. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $L_{conn} \approx 100-1000$ m across plasma radius. JET: $30-300$ m. DIII-D: $15-150$ m. Values increase from core to edge following safety factor profile.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing total field line length for poloidal transit.
