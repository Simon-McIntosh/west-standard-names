name: position_of_primary_x_point
description: Position vector of primary X-point.
documentation: Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the primary X-point in
  cylindrical coordinates. Marks the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes ($\mathbf{B}_{pol}
  = 0$) and separatrix branches intersect. Fundamental topological feature defining
  diverted plasma configuration and divertor geometry.
