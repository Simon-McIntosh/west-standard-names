description: Position vector of primary X-point.
documentation: |-
  Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the primary X-point in cylindrical coordinates. This fundamental geometric quantity marks the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes ($\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$) and separatrix branches intersect in diverted tokamak configurations.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{r}_{X} = (R_{X}, Z_{X})$$

  where $R_{X}$ is the major radius and $Z_{X}$ is the vertical height of the X-point.

  Physical significance: This quantity marks the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes ($\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$) and separatrix branches intersect. Fundamental topological feature defining diverted plasma configuration and divertor geometry. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The X-point position determines the divertor configuration (single-null vs double-null) and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  In single-null configurations, the primary X-point is the main magnetic null. In double-null configurations, it corresponds to the more active X-point (higher power flux). The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings, typically located below the midplane for lower single-null configurations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and magnetic field topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $(R, Z) \approx (8.5, -1.8)$ m for lower single-null. JET: $(3.6, -1.5)$ m. DIII-D: $(2.2, -1.0)$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when $R$ points outward from tokamak symmetry axis and $Z$ points upward from midplane.
