name: position_of_active_limiter_point
description: Position vector of active limiter contact point.
documentation: |-
  Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the active limiter point in cylindrical coordinates. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the tangency point between plasma boundary and limiter surface in limited tokamak configurations.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{r}_{limiter} = (R_{limiter}, Z_{limiter})$$

  where $R_{limiter}$ is the major radius and $Z_{limiter}$ is the vertical height of the limiter contact point.

  Physical significance: This quantity marks the tangency point between plasma boundary and limiter surface, defining the outer edge of confined plasma in limited configuration. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis. The limiter position affects plasma-wall interaction physics and determines the last closed flux surface location.

  The active limiter point influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions and affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) in limiter configurations. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma size and shape. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  In limited configurations, the plasma boundary is defined by the limiter surface, with the last closed flux surface tangent to the limiter at this contact point. The position determines the effective minor radius and affects all geometric calculations for plasma parameters.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using limiter geometry and plasma boundary conditions. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $(R, Z) \approx (8.2, 0.0)$ m for equatorial limiter. JET: $(3.7, 0.0)$ m. DIII-D: $(2.3, 0.0)$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when $R$ points outward from tokamak symmetry axis and $Z$ points upward from midplane.
