description: Poloidal circumference of plasma boundary at outboard midplane.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal circumference $L_{pol}$ of plasma boundary measured along field line at outer midplane. This fundamental geometric quantity represents the total length around the poloidal contour of the plasma boundary.

  Governing equation:
  $$L_{pol} = \oint_{\text{boundary}} \sqrt{dR^2 + dZ^2}$$

  where the integral is taken around the closed plasma boundary contour in the poloidal plane.

  Physical significance: This quantity measures the poloidal circumference of plasma boundary at outer midplane. Arc length around poloidal contour of boundary. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The poloidal circumference affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through connection length calculations and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through geometric changes. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma shape. The circumference affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  Related to connection length and parallel transport. The circumference is used to calculate connection lengths for parallel transport analysis and affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through geometric factors. Larger circumference improves parallel connection but may increase losses.

  For shaped plasmas with elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$, the poloidal circumference is larger than that of a circular plasma with the same minor radius. The circumference affects transport through geometric factors and influences [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) through connection lengths.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $L_{pol} \approx 20-30$ m. JET: $8-15$ m. DIII-D: $4-8$ m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing total poloidal arc length of plasma boundary.
