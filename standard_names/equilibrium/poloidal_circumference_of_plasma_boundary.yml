name: poloidal_circumference_of_plasma_boundary
description: Poloidal circumference of plasma boundary at outboard midplane.
documentation: 'Poloidal circumference $L_{pol}$ of plasma boundary measured along
  field line at outer midplane. Arc length around poloidal contour of boundary: $L_{pol}
  = \oint \sqrt{dR^2 + dZ^2}$. Related to connection length and parallel transport.
  Typical values: 10-30 m depending on elongation and device size.'
