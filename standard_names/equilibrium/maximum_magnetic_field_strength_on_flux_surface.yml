name: maximum_magnetic_field_strength_on_flux_surface
description: Maximum magnetic field strength on flux surface (obsolescent).
documentation: Maximum value of magnetic field magnitude $B_{max}$ on each flux surface.
  Occurs at inboard midplane for standard tokamak due to $1/R$ toroidal field variation.
  **Note:** Marked as obsolescent in IMAS DD v3.5.0. Used for trapped particle fraction
  and mirror ratio calculations.
