name: lower_elongation_of_plasma_boundary
description: Lower half elongation of plasma boundary.
documentation: Elongation $\kappa_{lower}$ of lower half of plasma boundary relative
  to geometric axis. Defined as $(Z_{axis} - Z_{min})/(R_{max} - R_{min})$ where $Z_{axis}$
  is the geometric axis height. Used to characterize vertical asymmetry in plasma
  shape, particularly in single-null diverted configurations.
