name: flux_surface_averaged_major_radius
description: Radial profile of flux surface averaged major radius.
documentation: Flux surface averaged major radius $\langle R \rangle$ weighted by
  inverse Jacobian. Defines effective geometric center of flux surface. Used in neoclassical
  transport calculations and trapped particle fraction. Shafranov shift increases
  $\langle R \rangle$ with pressure. Related to toroidal current via force balance.
