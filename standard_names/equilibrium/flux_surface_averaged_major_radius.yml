name: flux_surface_averaged_major_radius
description: Flux surface averaged major radius.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged major radius $\langle R \rangle$ weighted by inverse Jacobian. Fundamental geometric moment (gm2) defining effective geometric center of flux surfaces. Critical for neoclassical transport calculations and trapped particle physics.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle R \rangle = \frac{\oint R / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  Physical significance: This quantity determines the effective major radius for transport calculations and appears in the bounce-averaged particle motion. Related to [radial_centroid_of_flux_surface](#radial_centroid_of_flux_surface) but includes Jacobian weighting. Shafranov shift increases $\langle R \rangle$ with pressure and current. Essential for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as gm2 geometric moment. Used in [toroidal_current_density](#toroidal_current_density) calculations and force balance relations.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle R \rangle \approx 6.2-6.8$ m across plasma radius. JET: $2.9-3.4$ m. DIII-D: $1.6-1.8$ m. Values increase from core to edge due to Shafranov shift and geometric expansion.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric center location.
