name: trapped_particle_fraction
description: Radial profile of trapped particle fraction.
documentation: 'Fraction $f_{trap}(\rho)$ of particles trapped in magnetic wells due
  to toroidicity. Depends on inverse aspect ratio: $f_{trap} \approx 1.46 \sqrt{\epsilon}$
  for circular cross-section. Trapped particles cannot carry current, reducing conductivity.
  Bootstrap current proportional to $f_{trap}$. Larger at outer radii where $\epsilon$
  increases.'
