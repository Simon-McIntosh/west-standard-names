description: Radial profile of magnetic shear.
documentation: Magnetic shear $s = (r/q)(dq/dr)$ measuring rate of safety factor variation.
  Stabilizes drift waves and ballooning modes. High shear ($|s| > 1$) improves confinement
  but reduces bootstrap current. Reversed shear regions ($s < 0$) enable advanced
  scenarios with internal transport barriers.
