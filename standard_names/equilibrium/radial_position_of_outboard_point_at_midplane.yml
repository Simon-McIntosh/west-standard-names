name: radial_position_of_outboard_point_at_midplane
description: Radial coordinate of outboard flux surface point at midplane.
documentation: Major radius $R_{outboard}(\rho)$ of outboard midplane intersection
  of flux surface. Defines outer limit of flux surface at $Z = Z_{mag}$. Minor radius
  $a = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$. Shafranov shift and elongation affect outboard
  position. Used for profile mapping and coordinate transformations.
