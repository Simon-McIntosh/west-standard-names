description: Radial coordinate of outboard flux surface point at midplane.
documentation: |-
  Major radius $R_{outboard}(\rho)$ of outboard midplane intersection of flux surface. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the outer limit of flux surface at $Z = Z_{mag}$ in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{outboard}(\rho) = \text{major radius at outboard midplane intersection}$$

  where $\rho$ is the flux surface coordinate and $Z_{mag}$ is the magnetic axis height.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines outer limit of flux surface at $Z = Z_{mag}$. Minor radius $a = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Shafranov shift and elongation affect outboard position and influence [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and determines the effective plasma size. The position affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  The outboard point position is related to the inboard point through the flux surface shape and determines the minor radius through $a = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$. For circular geometry, $R_{outboard} = R_0 + a$, but in shaped plasmas the relationship is affected by elongation and triangularity.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{outboard} \approx 6.4-8.2$ m across plasma radius. JET: $3.2-3.7$ m. DIII-D: $1.8-2.3$ m. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
