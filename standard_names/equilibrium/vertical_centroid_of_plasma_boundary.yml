name: vertical_centroid_of_plasma_boundary
description: Height of geometric center of plasma boundary.
documentation: |-
  Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the geometric axis of the plasma boundary, defined as $(Z_{min} + Z_{max})/2$ where $Z_{min}$ and $Z_{max}$ are the lowest and highest vertical positions of the boundary contour. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the vertical center of the plasma boundary.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{centroid} = \frac{Z_{min} + Z_{max}}{2}$$

  where $Z_{min}$ and $Z_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum vertical coordinates of the plasma boundary contour.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the vertical center of the plasma boundary together with radial position forms the reference point for plasma shape characterization. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The vertical centroid affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma shaping effects. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma shape. The position affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  For up-down symmetric plasmas, the vertical centroid is at the midplane ($Z = 0$). In shaped plasmas with elongation, the centroid may be displaced from the geometric center due to triangularity effects and control system settings.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $Z_{centroid} \approx 0.0$ m for symmetric plasmas. JET: $0.0$ m. DIII-D: $0.0$ m. Values may vary with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured upward from tokamak midplane.
