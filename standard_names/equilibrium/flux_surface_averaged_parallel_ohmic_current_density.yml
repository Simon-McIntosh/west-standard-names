name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_ohmic_current_density
description: Parallel Ohmic current density from resistive diffusion.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged Ohmic current density $\langle j_{Ohm} \rangle$ from resistive diffusion of toroidal electric field. Primary current source in Ohmic plasmas and baseline component in auxiliary heated scenarios.

  Governing equation:
  $$j_{Ohm} = \sigma E_{tor} \quad \text{where} \quad \sigma \propto T_e^{3/2}$$

  Physical significance: This quantity represents the resistive current driven by toroidal electric field. Dominant in Ohmic plasmas but supplemented by [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) and external [current_drive](#current_drive) in heated scenarios. Related to [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) and [electric_field](#electric_field). Essential for [current_ramp](#current_ramp) scenarios and [skin_current](#skin_current) analysis.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using Spitzer resistivity and toroidal electric field. Requires [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profiles and [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity) calculations. Used in [current_evolution](#current_evolution) modeling and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle j_{Ohm} \rangle \approx 0.5-2.0$ MA/m$^2$ in Ohmic phase. JET: $0.3-1.5$ MA/m$^2$. DIII-D: $0.4-1.8$ MA/m$^2$. Values decrease during current ramp as temperature increases.

  Sign convention: Positive when in direction of plasma current (counter-clockwise viewing from above).
