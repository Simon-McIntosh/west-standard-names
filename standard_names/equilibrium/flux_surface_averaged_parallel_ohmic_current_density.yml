name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_ohmic_current_density
description: Radial profile of parallel Ohmic current density.
documentation: 'Flux surface averaged Ohmic current density $\langle j_{Ohm} \rangle$
  from resistive diffusion of toroidal electric field. Dominant current source in
  Ohmic plasmas: $j_{Ohm} = \sigma E_{tor}$ where $\sigma \propto T_e^{3/2}$. In auxiliary
  heated plasmas, supplemented by bootstrap and driven currents. Skin current during
  current ramp.'
