description: Derivative of flux surface volume with respect to toroidal flux coordinate.
documentation: |-
  Radial derivative $dV/d\rho_{tor}$ of volume enclosed by flux surface with respect to toroidal flux coordinate. This geometric quantity relates toroidal flux coordinates to volume in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dV}{d\rho_{tor}} = \frac{d}{d\rho_{tor}} \iiint_{\text{flux surface}} dV$$

  where $V$ is the volume and $\rho_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity equals flux surface area in toroidal flux coordinates: $dV/d\rho_{tor} = A(\rho_{tor})$. Used in transport codes for volume-integrated quantities and particle/energy balance equations. Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [transport_modeling](#transport_modeling).

  The derivative $dV/d\rho_{tor}$ represents the rate of change of volume with respect to the toroidal flux coordinate. In circular geometry, this derivative is approximately constant, but in shaped plasmas it varies significantly with flux surface shape and position. This quantity is particularly important for accurate transport modeling and equilibrium reconstruction in non-circular tokamak equilibria.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry and toroidal flux coordinate values. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for accurate mapping between toroidal flux coordinates and physical space.

  Typical values: ITER: $dV/d\rho_{tor} \approx 10-50$ m$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $3-15$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $1-8$ m$^2$. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion and geometric effects.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric volume change with toroidal flux coordinate.
