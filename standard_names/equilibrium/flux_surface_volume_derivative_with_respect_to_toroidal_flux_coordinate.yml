name: flux_surface_volume_derivative_with_respect_to_toroidal_flux_coordinate
description: Derivative of flux surface volume with respect to toroidal flux coordinate.
documentation: Radial derivative $dV/d\rho_{tor}$ of volume enclosed by flux surface.
  Equals flux surface area in toroidal flux coordinates. Used in transport codes for
  volume-integrated quantities and particle/energy balance equations.
