name: vertical_position_of_primary_strike_point
description: Height of primary strike point location.
documentation: |-
  Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the primary strike point. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the vertical position where the separatrix contacts the divertor target in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{strike} = \text{vertical height of primary strike point}$$

  where $Z_{strike}$ is the vertical coordinate of the strike point on the divertor target.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the vertical position where separatrix contacts divertor target. Critical for calculating strike point angle, connection length, and divertor heat flux footprint width. Essential for [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) and plasma-wall interaction analysis.

  The strike point vertical position determines heat and particle flux distribution on divertor tiles and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  The vertical position is typically below the midplane for lower single-null configurations, with the exact location determined by the X-point position and field line connection geometry. The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and divertor target geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $Z_{strike} \approx -1.5$ m for lower single-null. JET: $-1.2$ m. DIII-D: $-0.8$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and X-point location.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured upward from tokamak midplane.
