description: Surface area of toroidal plasma boundary.
documentation: |-
  Surface area $S$ of the toroidal flux surface forming the plasma boundary. This fundamental geometric quantity represents the total surface area of the last closed flux surface in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$S = \oint_{\text{poloidal}} 2\pi R \, dl_{\text{pol}}$$

  where the integral is taken around the poloidal circumference and $R$ is the major radius coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity represents the surface area of the toroidal flux surface forming the plasma boundary. For axisymmetric plasma: $S = \oint dl_{pol} \cdot 2\pi R$ where integral is around poloidal circumference. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The surface area affects [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) through particle confinement time and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through surface-to-volume ratio effects. Critical for [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) calculations and determines the effective plasma size. The area affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  Larger surface area increases plasma-wall interaction and affects [particle_confinement_time](#particle_confinement_time). The surface area is related to plasma volume through geometric factors and affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) through connection lengths and surface effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $S \approx 500-1000$ m$^2$. JET: $150-300$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $80-150$ m$^2$. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing total toroidal surface area of plasma boundary.
