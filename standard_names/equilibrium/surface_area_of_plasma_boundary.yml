name: surface_area_of_plasma_boundary
description: Surface area of toroidal plasma boundary.
documentation: 'Surface area $S$ of the toroidal flux surface forming the plasma boundary.
  For axisymmetric plasma: $S = \oint dl_{pol} \cdot 2\pi R$ where integral is around
  poloidal circumference. Related to plasma-wall interaction area and particle confinement
  time. Larger surface-to-volume ratio increases particle losses.'
