name: plasma_boundary
description: Definition of the plasma boundary surface used for geometric measurements.
documentation: |-
  Defines the outermost confined flux surface used as the plasma boundary reference for geometric quantities. This standard name serves as a definitional anchor documenting which flux surface is considered the plasma boundary in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\psi_{boundary} = \text{poloidal flux at plasma boundary}$$

  where $\psi_{boundary}$ is the poloidal flux value at the outermost confined flux surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the outermost confined flux surface used as the plasma boundary reference. In tokamak equilibria, the plasma boundary can be defined as the separatrix (last closed flux surface) where normalized poloidal flux $\psi_{norm} = 1.0$. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  For diverted configurations: The separatrix (last closed flux surface) where normalized poloidal flux $\psi_{norm} = 1.0$. The separatrix passes through the X-point where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes. For limited configurations: The flux surface tangent to the limiter, defining the last closed flux surface before plasma-wall contact.

  The plasma boundary affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions and influences [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma size. The boundary affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations through geometric factors.

  When using geometric quantities, data producers should document which normalized flux coordinate value corresponds to their plasma boundary definition. This allows consistent interpretation across different codes and diagnostic systems.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry and boundary conditions. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: $\psi_{norm} = 1.0$ for separatrix boundary. For fixed-boundary codes: $\psi_{norm} \approx 0.99$ or $0.999$. For transport codes: $\rho_{pol} = 0.95$. Values vary with plasma configuration and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when normalized flux coordinate increases from magnetic axis to plasma boundary.
