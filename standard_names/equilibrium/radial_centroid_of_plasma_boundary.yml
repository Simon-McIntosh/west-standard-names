name: radial_centroid_of_plasma_boundary
description: Major radius of geometric center of plasma boundary.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the geometric axis of the plasma boundary, defined as $(R_{min} + R_{max})/2$ where $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ are the innermost and outermost radial positions of the boundary contour. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the radial center of the plasma boundary.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{centroid} = \frac{R_{min} + R_{max}}{2}$$

  where $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum major radius coordinates of the plasma boundary contour.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the radial center of the plasma boundary together with vertical position forms the reference point for plasma shape characterization. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The radial centroid affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma shaping effects. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma shape. The position affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  The radial centroid position is used to calculate elongation $\kappa = (Z_{max} - Z_{min})/(R_{max} - R_{min})$ and triangularity $\delta = (R_{centroid} - R_{X-point})/a$ for plasma shape characterization. For up-down symmetric plasmas, the radial centroid may be displaced from the geometric center due to Shafranov shift effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{centroid} \approx 6.4$ m for symmetric plasmas. JET: $3.1$ m. DIII-D: $1.75$ m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
