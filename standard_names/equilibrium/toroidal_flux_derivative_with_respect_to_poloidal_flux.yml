name: toroidal_flux_derivative_with_respect_to_poloidal_flux
description: Radial profile of toroidal flux derivative with respect to poloidal flux.
documentation: Derivative $d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$ relating toroidal and poloidal flux
  increments. Equals safety factor $q$ by definition. Used in flux coordinate transformations
  and equilibrium solvers. Monotonically increasing for standard tokamak profiles.
  Jump discontinuities indicate rational surfaces with magnetic islands.
