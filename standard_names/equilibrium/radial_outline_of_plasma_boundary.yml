name: radial_outline_of_plasma_boundary
description: Major radius points defining plasma boundary contour.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of points forming the plasma boundary outline in the poloidal cross-section. This fundamental geometric quantity represents the major radius values of the boundary contour array.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{boundary}(\theta) = \text{major radius at poloidal angle } \theta$$

  where $\theta$ is the poloidal angle parameter around the closed contour of the plasma boundary.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the major radius of points forming the plasma boundary outline in the poloidal cross-section. Array of $R$ values paired with corresponding $Z$ values forming closed contour. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The radial outline affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma shaping effects. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma shape. The outline affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  For fixed-boundary equilibrium codes, typically taken at $\psi_{norm} \approx 0.99$ of separatrix value. For free-boundary codes, represents the separatrix (last closed flux surface) where $\psi = \psi_{sep}$. The outline determines the effective plasma size and shape, affecting all geometric calculations for plasma parameters.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{boundary} \approx 4.4-8.4$ m for boundary contour. JET: $2.0-4.0$ m. DIII-D: $1.1-2.3$ m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
