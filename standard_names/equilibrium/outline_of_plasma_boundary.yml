name: outline_of_plasma_boundary
description: Position vector contour defining plasma boundary shape.
documentation: |-
  Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ defining the closed contour of the plasma boundary in cylindrical coordinates. This fundamental geometric quantity represents the poloidal outline of the last closed flux surface.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{r}_{boundary}(\theta) = (R(\theta), Z(\theta))$$

  where $\theta$ is the poloidal angle parameter around the closed contour of the plasma boundary.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the closed contour of the plasma boundary in the $(R,Z)$ plane. Array of position vectors forming the poloidal outline of the last closed flux surface. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The boundary outline affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma shaping effects. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma shape. The outline affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  Used in equilibrium codes to define computational domain boundary or as constraint for free-boundary reconstruction. The outline determines the effective plasma size and shape, affecting all geometric calculations for plasma parameters. The contour is used to calculate elongation, triangularity, and other shaping parameters.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R \approx 4.4-8.4$ m, $Z \approx \pm 3.4$ m for boundary contour. JET: $R \approx 2.0-4.0$ m, $Z \approx \pm 1.8$ m. DIII-D: $R \approx 1.1-2.3$ m, $Z \approx \pm 1.2$ m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when $R$ points outward from tokamak symmetry axis and $Z$ points upward from midplane.
