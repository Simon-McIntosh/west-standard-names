name: flux_surface_averaged_lower_triangularity
description: Radial profile of flux surface averaged lower triangularity.
documentation: Flux surface averaged lower triangularity $\langle \delta_{lower} \rangle$
  with respect to magnetic axis. Measures D-shape character of lower half of flux
  surfaces. Important for divertor configuration and vertical asymmetry characterization.
