name: radial_position_of_inboard_point_at_outboard_midplane_height
description: Radial coordinate of inboard flux surface point at outboard midplane
  height.
documentation: Major radius $R_{inboard}(\rho, Z=Z_{mag})$ of inboard intersection
  of flux surface with midplane. Defines inner limit of flux surface at magnetic axis
  height. Used for geometric profile construction and flux surface shape characterization.
  Shafranov shift moves inboard point outward with increasing pressure.
