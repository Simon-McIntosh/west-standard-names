description: Radial coordinate of inboard flux surface point at outboard midplane
  height.
documentation: |-
  Major radius $R_{inboard}(\rho, Z=Z_{mag})$ of inboard intersection of flux surface with midplane. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the inner limit of flux surface at magnetic axis height in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{inboard}(\rho, Z=Z_{mag}) = \text{major radius at inboard midplane intersection}$$

  where $\rho$ is the flux surface coordinate and $Z_{mag}$ is the magnetic axis height.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines inner limit of flux surface at magnetic axis height. Used for geometric profile construction and flux surface shape characterization. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Shafranov shift moves inboard point outward with increasing pressure and affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through geometric changes. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and determines the effective plasma shape. The position affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  The inboard point position is related to the outboard point through the flux surface shape and determines the minor radius through $a = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$. For circular geometry, $R_{inboard} = R_0 - a$, but in shaped plasmas the relationship is more complex due to elongation and triangularity effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{inboard} \approx 4.2-6.0$ m across plasma radius. JET: $2.0-2.9$ m. DIII-D: $1.0-1.6$ m. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
