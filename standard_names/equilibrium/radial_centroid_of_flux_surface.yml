description: Geometric major radius of flux surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Geometric major radius $R_{geo}(\rho) = (R_{inboard} + R_{outboard})/2$ defining flux surface center. This fundamental geometric parameter characterizes the radial position of flux surfaces in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{geo}(\rho) = \frac{R_{inboard}(\rho) + R_{outboard}(\rho)}{2}$$

  where $R_{inboard}$ and $R_{outboard}$ are the major radius coordinates at the inboard and outboard midplane intersections of the flux surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity increases with radius due to Shafranov shift from pressure and current effects: $R_{geo}(\rho) = R_0 + \Delta(\rho)$ where $\Delta$ is the Shafranov shift. Used for approximate geometric calculations and profile mapping. Differs from flux surface averaged $\langle R \rangle$ by $O(\epsilon^2)$ corrections where $\epsilon = a/R_0$ is the inverse aspect ratio.

  The geometric centroid affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through the major radius dependence and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through aspect ratio variations. Shafranov shift increases $R_{geo}$ with pressure and current, affecting [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  For circular geometry, $R_{geo}$ is constant at $R_0$, but in shaped plasmas it varies with flux surface position due to geometric effects. The difference $R_{geo} - R_0$ represents the outward displacement of flux surface centers due to finite pressure and current effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{geo} \approx 6.2-6.8$ m across plasma radius. JET: $2.9-3.4$ m. DIII-D: $1.6-1.8$ m. Values increase from core to edge due to Shafranov shift and geometric expansion. Core values typically $R_0 + 0.1-0.3$ m for ITER-scale devices.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric center location of flux surface.
