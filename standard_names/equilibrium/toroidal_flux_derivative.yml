name: toroidal_flux_derivative
description: Radial derivative of toroidal flux.
documentation: |-
  Radial gradient $d\Phi_{tor}/d\rho$ of toroidal flux. This fundamental quantity characterizes the rate of change of toroidal flux with respect to radial position in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{d\Phi_{tor}}{d\rho} = \frac{d}{d\rho} \iint_{\text{surface}} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$$


  where $\Phi_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux and the integral is taken over the poloidal cross-section.


  Physical significance: This quantity relates to flux surface area and magnetic field through flux conservation. Used in transport calculations for flux gradient terms. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Determines relationship between flux coordinates and geometric coordinates. The derivative affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q = d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$ and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through equilibrium forces. Critical for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  Essential for coordinate system transformations. The derivative determines the relationship between normalized flux coordinates and affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using toroidal flux geometry and radial derivatives. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $d\Phi_{tor}/d\rho \approx 1-10$ Wb/m across plasma radius. JET: $0.5-5$ Wb/m. DIII-D: $0.3-3$ Wb/m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when toroidal flux increases with radial coordinate.
