name: toroidal_flux_derivative
description: Radial profile of radial derivative of toroidal flux.
documentation: Radial gradient $d\Phi_{tor}/d\rho$ of toroidal flux. Related to flux
  surface area and magnetic field through flux conservation. Used in transport calculations
  for flux gradient terms. Determines relationship between flux coordinates and geometric
  coordinates. Essential for coordinate system transformations.
