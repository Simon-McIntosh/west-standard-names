description: Radial profile of geometric minor radius of flux surfaces.
documentation: Geometric minor radius $a_{geo}(\rho) = (R_{outboard} - R_{inboard})/2$
  measuring half-width of flux surface at midplane. Increases monotonically from 0
  at axis to $a$ at boundary. Used for normalized radial coordinate $\rho = a_{geo}/a$
  and profile parameterization. Differs from flux-based coordinates by geometry effects.
