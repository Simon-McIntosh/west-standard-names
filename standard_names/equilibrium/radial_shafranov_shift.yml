description: Radial profile of Shafranov radial shift of flux surfaces.
documentation: 'Shafranov shift $\Delta(\rho) = R_{geo}(\rho) - R_{geo}(0)$ measuring
  outward displacement of flux surface centers. Driven by plasma pressure and toroidal
  current: $\Delta \propto \beta_{pol} + l_i/2$. Positive (outward) shift increases
  with pressure. Affects aspect ratio and trapped particle fraction. Large shifts
  can limit achievable beta.'
