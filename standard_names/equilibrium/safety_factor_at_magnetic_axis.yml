description: Safety factor at magnetic axis.
documentation: 'Safety factor $q_0$ at the magnetic axis where flux surfaces are centered.
  Minimum value of safety factor profile. For tokamaks with monotonic q-profile: $q_0
  < 1$ can trigger sawtooth oscillations via internal kink instability. Typical range:
  0.7-1.2. Core MHD stability strongly dependent on $q_0$ value.'
