name: toroidal_flux_coordinate
description: Toroidal flux coordinate for radial position.
documentation: |-
  Toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\Phi_{tor}/(\pi B_0)}$ where $\Phi_{tor}$ is toroidal flux and $B_0$ is vacuum toroidal field at reference position. This fundamental quantity provides dimensional radial coordinate in meters for tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\frac{\Phi_{tor}}{\pi B_0}}$$


  where $\Phi_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux and $B_0$ is the vacuum toroidal field at reference position.


  Physical significance: This quantity provides dimensional radial coordinate in meters. Related to normalized coordinate: $\rho_{tor,norm} = \rho_{tor}/\rho_{tor,boundary}$. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Used in transport codes and profile fitting. The toroidal flux coordinate affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through coordinate transformations and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through geometric factors. Critical for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  The coordinate is used to define the relationship between flux surfaces and affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors. Essential for coordinate transformations and transport modeling.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using toroidal flux geometry and reference field values. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $\rho_{tor} \approx 0.1-2.0$ m across plasma radius. JET: $0.05-1.0$ m. DIII-D: $0.03-0.67$ m. Values increase from magnetic axis to plasma boundary.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing radial distance from magnetic axis.
