name: toroidal_flux_coordinate
description: Radial profile of toroidal flux coordinate.
documentation: 'Toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\Phi_{tor}/(\pi B_0)}$
  where $\Phi_{tor}$ is toroidal flux and $B_0$ is vacuum toroidal field at reference
  position. Dimensional radial coordinate in meters. Related to normalized coordinate:
  $\rho_{tor,norm} = \rho_{tor}/\rho_{tor,boundary}$. Used in transport codes and
  profile fitting.'
