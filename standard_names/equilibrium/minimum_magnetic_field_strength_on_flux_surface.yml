name: minimum_magnetic_field_strength_on_flux_surface
description: Minimum magnetic field strength on flux surface (obsolescent).
documentation: Minimum value of magnetic field magnitude $B_{min}$ on each flux surface.
  Occurs at outboard midplane for standard tokamak configuration. **Note:** Marked
  as obsolescent in IMAS DD v3.5.0. Defines magnetic well depth and trapped particle
  boundary.
