description: Minimum magnetic field strength on flux surface (obsolescent).
documentation: |-
  Minimum value of magnetic field magnitude $B_{min}$ on each flux surface. Occurs at outboard midplane for standard tokamak configuration. **Note:** Marked as obsolescent in IMAS DD v3.5.0. Defines magnetic well depth and trapped particle boundary.

  Governing equation:
  $$B_{min}(\rho) = \min_{\theta} B(\rho, \theta)$$

  where the minimum is taken over the poloidal angle $\theta$ on the flux surface at radial position $\rho$.

  Physical significance: This quantity was historically used to define magnetic well depth and trapped particle boundaries. However, it has been largely superseded by more sophisticated geometric moments like [flux_surface_averaged_inverse_squared_magnetic_field_strength](#flux_surface_averaged_inverse_squared_magnetic_field_strength) (gm5) for neoclassical transport theory. The minimum field value alone does not capture the full magnetic topology effects on particle orbits.

  For modern applications, the geometric moment gm5 = $\langle 1/B^2 \rangle$ provides a more accurate representation of magnetic field effects on trapped particles and transport. This quantity is essential for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) formulations.

  In standard tokamak geometry, $B_{min}$ occurs at the outboard midplane where the major radius $R$ is maximum. The field variation $B(\theta) \propto 1/R(\theta)$ follows the flux surface shape, with elongation and triangularity affecting the exact location and magnitude of the minimum.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using complete magnetic field geometry. Available from IMAS equilibrium IDS but marked as obsolescent. For current applications, use gm5 geometric moment instead.

  Typical values: ITER: $B_{min} \approx 3-5$ T across plasma radius. JET: $2-3.5$ T. DIII-D: $1.5-2.2$ T. Values decrease from core to edge following toroidal field $1/R$ variation.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing minimum magnetic field magnitude on flux surface.
