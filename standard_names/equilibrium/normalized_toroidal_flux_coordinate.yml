name: normalized_toroidal_flux_coordinate
description: Radial profile of normalized toroidal flux coordinate.
documentation: Normalized toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor,norm}(\rho) = \sqrt{\Phi_{tor}/\Phi_{tor,boundary}}$.
  Standard radial coordinate for IMAS equilibrium profiles. Monotonically increasing
  from 0 (axis) to 1 (boundary). Used as independent variable for profiles_1d arrays.
  Approximately equal to normalized minor radius in circular plasmas.
