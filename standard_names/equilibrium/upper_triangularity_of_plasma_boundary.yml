description: Upper triangularity of plasma boundary.
documentation: Upper triangularity $\delta_{upper}$ characterizing D-shape of upper
  half of plasma boundary. Defined as horizontal displacement of upper midplane point
  from geometric axis normalized by minor radius. Used to characterize shape asymmetry
  and MHD stability properties in double-null configurations.
