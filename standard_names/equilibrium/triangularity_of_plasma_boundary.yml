name: triangularity_of_plasma_boundary
description: Triangularity of plasma boundary cross-section.
documentation: 'Triangularity $\delta$ of the plasma boundary, measuring D-shape character
  of poloidal cross-section. Defined as horizontal displacement of midplane point
  relative to geometric axis, normalized by minor radius. Positive triangularity shifts
  plasma toward D-shape (more peaked on inboard side). Typical values: 0.2-0.5 for
  conventional tokamaks, negative for negative triangularity experiments.'
