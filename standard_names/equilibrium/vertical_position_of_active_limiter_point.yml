name: vertical_position_of_active_limiter_point
description: Height of active limiter contact point.
documentation: |-
  Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the active limiter point. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the vertical position where the plasma boundary contacts the limiter surface in limited tokamak configurations.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{limiter} = \text{vertical height of limiter contact point}$$

  where $Z_{limiter}$ is the vertical coordinate of the tangency point between plasma boundary and limiter surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the vertical position where plasma boundary touches the limiter, establishing the outermost confined flux surface in limited operation. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The limiter vertical position influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions and affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) in limiter configurations. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma size and shape. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  In limited configurations, the plasma boundary is defined by the limiter surface, with the last closed flux surface tangent to the limiter at this vertical position. For equatorial limiters, $Z_{limiter} = 0$ (midplane), but for other limiter configurations the position may vary.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using limiter geometry and plasma boundary conditions. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $Z_{limiter} \approx 0.0$ m for equatorial limiter. JET: $0.0$ m. DIII-D: $0.0$ m. Position varies with limiter configuration and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured upward from tokamak midplane.
