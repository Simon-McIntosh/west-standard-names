name: elongation_of_plasma_boundary
description: Elongation of plasma boundary cross-section.
documentation: 'Elongation $\kappa$ of the plasma boundary, measuring vertical stretching
  of the poloidal cross-section. Defined as ratio of vertical to horizontal extent.
  Full elongation: $\kappa = (Z_{max} - Z_{min})/(R_{max} - R_{min})$. Higher elongation
  improves confinement but reduces MHD stability margins. Typical values: 1.0 (circular)
  to 2.0 (highly elongated).'
