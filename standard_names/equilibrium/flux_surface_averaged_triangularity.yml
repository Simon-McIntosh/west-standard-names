name: flux_surface_averaged_triangularity
description: Radial profile of flux surface averaged triangularity.
documentation: 'Flux surface averaged triangularity $\langle \delta \rangle$ measuring
  horizontal asymmetry. Average of local triangularity over flux surface. Positive
  triangularity (D-shape) standard in tokamaks, improves H-mode access. Negative triangularity
  being explored for enhanced stability. Typical values: 0.2-0.5.'
