name: volume_enclosed_by_flux_surface
description: Volume enclosed inside a toroidal magnetic flux surface.
documentation: 'Volume $V(\rho)$ enclosed by a toroidal magnetic flux surface at radial
  position $\rho$. For axisymmetric toroidal geometry:


  $$V(\rho) = \int_0^\rho 2\pi R \, dA$$


  where the integral is over the poloidal cross-sectional area up to the flux surface.


  This quantity is essential for volume-averaged quantities, particle inventory calculations,
  and transport analysis. The derivative $dV/d\rho$ relates to the flux surface area
  and appears in transport equations.'
