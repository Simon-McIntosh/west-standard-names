description: Weight assigned to poloidal field probe measurement in reconstruction
  cost function.
documentation: Weight $w_i$ assigned to poloidal magnetic field probe measurement
  in equilibrium reconstruction cost function. Reconstruction minimizes $J = \frac{1}{2}
  \sum_i w_i^2 (B_{reconstructed,i} - B_{measured,i})^2 / \sigma_i^2$ where $\sigma_i$
  is measurement uncertainty. Higher weight increases influence of this diagnostic
  on final equilibrium solution.
