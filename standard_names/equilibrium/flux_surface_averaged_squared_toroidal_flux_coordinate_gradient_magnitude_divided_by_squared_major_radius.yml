  radius.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged geometric moment $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / R^2 \rangle$. This metric coefficient is used in neoclassical transport theory and gyrokinetic codes for tokamak plasma modeling.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / R^2 \rangle = \frac{\oint (|\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / R^2) / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  where $\rho_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux coordinate and $R$ is the major radius.

  Physical significance: This quantity appears in drift kinetic equation and bounce-averaged transport coefficients. Essential for accurate [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and [gyrokinetic](#gyrokinetic) simulations. Critical for understanding particle transport in toroidal geometry and affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) formulations.

  The metric coefficient $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / R^2 \rangle$ represents the geometric weighting for toroidal effects in transport calculations. It influences particle orbits through major radius variations and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through kinetic coupling effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux coordinate gradients and major radius geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric moment. Used in [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and [gyrokinetic](#gyrokinetic) code inputs.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / R^2 \rangle \approx 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ m$^{-2}$ across plasma radius. JET: $10^{-4}-5 \times 10^{-4}$ m$^{-2}$. DIII-D: $5 \times 10^{-5}-3 \times 10^{-4}$ m$^{-2}$. Values typically decrease from core to edge due to geometric expansion.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric weighting for toroidal transport effects.
