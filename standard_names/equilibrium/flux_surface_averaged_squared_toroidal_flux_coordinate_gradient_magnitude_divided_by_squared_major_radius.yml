name: flux_surface_averaged_squared_toroidal_flux_coordinate_gradient_magnitude_divided_by_squared_major_radius
description: Flux surface average of squared gradient magnitude divided by squared
  major radius.
documentation: Flux surface averaged geometric moment $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2
  / R^2 \rangle$. Metric coefficient used in neoclassical transport theory and gyrokinetic
  codes. Appears in drift kinetic equation and bounce-averaged transport coefficients.
  Essential for accurate neoclassical conductivity calculations.
