name: radial_position_of_plasma_boundary_outline
description: Major radius points defining plasma boundary contour.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of points forming the plasma boundary
  outline in the poloidal cross-section. Array of $R$ values paired with corresponding
  $Z$ values forming closed contour. For fixed-boundary equilibrium codes, typically
  taken at $\psi_{norm} \approx 0.99$ of separatrix value. For free-boundary codes,
  represents the separatrix (last closed flux surface) where $\psi = \psi_{sep}$.
