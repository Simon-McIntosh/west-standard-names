name: poloidal_magnetic_flux_profile
description: Poloidal magnetic flux labeling flux surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic flux $\psi(\rho)$ as function of flux surface coordinate. This fundamental quantity represents the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation that labels flux surfaces in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Delta^* \psi = -\mu_0 R^2 p'(\psi) - F F'(\psi)$$


  where $\Delta^*$ is the Grad-Shafranov elliptic operator, $p'$ is the pressure gradient, and $F F'$ is the toroidal current function.


  Physical significance: This quantity represents the fundamental solution of Grad-Shafranov equation. Used to define normalized flux coordinate $\psi_{norm} = (\psi - \psi_{axis})/(\psi_{boundary} - \psi_{axis})$. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Monotonically increasing from axis to boundary. The flux profile affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q = d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$ and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through equilibrium forces. Critical for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  The poloidal flux profile determines the magnetic topology and affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through flux surface geometry. Essential for coordinate transformations and transport modeling.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction solving the Grad-Shafranov equation. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as equilibrium quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $\psi \approx -5$ to $0$ Wb across plasma radius. JET: $-2$ to $0$ Wb. DIII-D: $-1$ to $0$ Wb. Values increase from magnetic axis to plasma boundary.

  Sign convention: Positive when poloidal flux increases from magnetic axis toward plasma boundary.
