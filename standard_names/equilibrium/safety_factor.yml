description: Radial profile of safety factor.
documentation: 'Safety factor profile $q(\rho) = (r/R_0)(B_{tor}/B_{pol})$ measuring
  field line winding. Ratio of toroidal to poloidal field line turns: after $q$ toroidal
  transits, field line completes one poloidal turn. Monotonic $q$ profiles stabilize
  MHD but limit performance. Reversed shear ($dq/d\rho < 0$ in core) enables internal
  transport barriers.'
