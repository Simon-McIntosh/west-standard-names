description: Flux surface area of nested toroidal surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface area $A(\rho)$ of each nested toroidal surface representing the total surface area of the toroidal flux surface.

  Governing equation:
  $$A(\rho) = \oint_{\text{poloidal}} 2\pi R \, dl_{\text{pol}}$$

  where the integral is taken around the poloidal circumference and $R$ is the major radius coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity is used in transport calculations and particle/energy balance equations. Related to volume through $dV/d\rho = A(\rho)$ for certain coordinate choices. Larger surface area increases plasma-wall interaction and affects [particle_confinement_time](#particle_confinement_time). Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations. Critical for understanding plasma-wall interaction physics and [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics).

  For circular flux surfaces: $A \approx 2\pi R_0 (2\pi a)$ where $R_0$ is major radius and $a$ is minor radius. Shaping parameters including elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$ significantly increase the surface area compared to circular cross-sections. The surface area affects the [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through connection length calculations and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through surface-to-volume ratio effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using complete flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [flux_surface_volume](#flux_surface_volume) integration and [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) calculations. Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) planning and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $A \approx 100-1000$ m$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $30-300$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $15-150$ m$^2$. Values increase significantly from core to edge due to geometric expansion. Peak values at plasma boundary typically 500-1000 m$^2$ for ITER-scale devices.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing total toroidal surface area of flux surface.
