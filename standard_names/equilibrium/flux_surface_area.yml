description: Radial profile of flux surface area.
documentation: 'Flux surface area $A(\rho)$ of each nested toroidal surface. Used
  in transport calculations and particle/energy balance. Related to volume: $dV/d\rho
  = A(\rho)$. Larger area increases plasma-wall interaction. For circular flux surfaces:
  $A \approx 2\pi R_0 (2\pi a)$. Shaping (elongation, triangularity) increases area.'
