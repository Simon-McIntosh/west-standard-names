description: Toroidal magnetic flux enclosed within flux surface.
documentation: |-
  Toroidal magnetic flux $\Phi_{tor}$ enclosed within a flux surface, defined as the surface integral of the magnetic field through a poloidal cross-section:

  $$\Phi_{tor} = \iint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$$

  where $S$ is the poloidal cross-section of the flux surface and $\mathbf{B}$ is the total magnetic field. The toroidal flux is a fundamental quantity for characterizing magnetic confinement in tokamaks.

  Related to poloidal flux $\psi$ via the safety factor: $q = d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$. Used to define the toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\Phi_{tor}/\pi B_0}$ where $B_0$ is the vacuum toroidal field at reference position. Monotonically increasing from axis to boundary with $\Phi_{tor,axis} = 0$.

  Sign convention: Positive when $d\mathbf{S}$ points counter-clockwise when viewed from above (positive toroidal direction).
