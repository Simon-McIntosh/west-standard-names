description: Lower triangularity of plasma boundary.
documentation: Lower triangularity $\delta_{lower}$ characterizing D-shape of lower
  half of plasma boundary. Defined as horizontal displacement of lower midplane point
  from geometric axis normalized by minor radius. Important for divertor configuration
  and heat flux distribution in lower single-null plasmas.
