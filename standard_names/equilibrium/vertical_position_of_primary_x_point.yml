description: Height of primary X-point location.
documentation: |-
  Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the primary X-point. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the vertical position where the separatrix branches meet and $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$ in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$Z_{X} = \text{vertical height of primary X-point}$$

  where $Z_{X}$ is the vertical coordinate of the magnetic null where $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the vertical position where separatrix branches meet and $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$. X-point height determines strike point angles and divertor closure. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The X-point vertical position determines the divertor configuration (single-null vs double-null) and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  Typical locations: below midplane for lower single-null, symmetric about midplane for double-null. The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings, typically located at $Z_{X} < 0$ for lower single-null configurations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and magnetic field topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $Z_{X} \approx -1.8$ m for lower single-null. JET: $-1.5$ m. DIII-D: $-1.0$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured upward from tokamak midplane.
