description: Height of primary X-point location.
documentation: 'Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the primary X-point. Together
  with radial position defines the $(R, Z)$ location where the separatrix branches
  meet and $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$. X-point height determines strike point angles and
  divertor closure. Typical locations: below midplane for lower single-null, symmetric
  about midplane for double-null.'
