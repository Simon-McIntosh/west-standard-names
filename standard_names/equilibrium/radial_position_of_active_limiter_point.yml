name: radial_position_of_active_limiter_point
description: Major radius of active limiter contact point.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the active limiter point where the plasma boundary contacts the limiter surface in limited configuration. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the radial extent of the confined plasma.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{limiter} = \text{major radius of limiter contact point}$$

  where $R_{limiter}$ is the radial coordinate of the tangency point between plasma boundary and limiter surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the radial extent of the confined plasma and the location of maximum plasma-wall interaction in limiter operation. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis. The limiter position affects plasma-wall interaction physics and determines the last closed flux surface location.

  The active limiter radial position influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions and affects [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) in limiter configurations. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma size and shape. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  In limited configurations, the plasma boundary is defined by the limiter surface, with the last closed flux surface tangent to the limiter at this radial position. The position determines the effective minor radius and affects all geometric calculations for plasma parameters.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using limiter geometry and plasma boundary conditions. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{limiter} \approx 8.2$ m for equatorial limiter. JET: $3.7$ m. DIII-D: $2.3$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
