name: flux_surface_area_derivative_with_respect_to_poloidal_flux
description: Derivative of flux surface cross-sectional area with respect to poloidal
  flux.
documentation: Radial derivative $dA/d\psi$ of poloidal cross-sectional area with
  respect to poloidal flux. Used in transport equation formulations relating flux-based
  and geometric coordinates. Essential for source term calculations in transport modeling.
