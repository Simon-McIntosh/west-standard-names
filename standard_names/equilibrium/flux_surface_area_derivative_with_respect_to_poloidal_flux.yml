  flux.
documentation: |-
  Radial derivative $dA/d\psi$ of poloidal cross-sectional area with respect to poloidal flux. This geometric quantity relates flux-based coordinates to geometric coordinates in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dA}{d\psi} = \frac{d}{d\psi} \oint_{\text{contour}} \frac{1}{2} (R \, dZ - Z \, dR)$$

  where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $\psi$ is the poloidal flux.

  Physical significance: This quantity is used in transport equation formulations relating flux-based and geometric coordinates. Essential for source term calculations in transport modeling and appears in the relationship between flux coordinate derivatives and geometric quantities. Critical for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) formulations. The derivative affects the mapping between normalized flux coordinates and physical radial positions.

  The derivative $dA/d\psi$ is related to the flux surface geometry through the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. In circular geometry, $dA/d\psi$ is approximately constant, but in shaped plasmas it varies significantly with flux surface shape and position. This quantity is particularly important for accurate transport modeling in non-circular tokamak equilibria.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry and poloidal flux values. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space.

  Typical values: ITER: $dA/d\psi \approx 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ m$^2$/Wb across plasma radius. JET: $10^{-3}-5 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$/Wb. DIII-D: $5 \times 10^{-4}-3 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$/Wb. Values typically decrease from core to edge due to geometric expansion effects.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric area change with flux coordinate.
