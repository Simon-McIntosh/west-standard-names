description: Internal inductance of plasma current distribution.
documentation: 'Normalized internal inductance $l_i(3)$ characterizing plasma current
  profile peaking. Defined by integral of current density profile. Larger $l_i$ indicates
  more peaked current (higher core current density). Affects MHD stability, confinement,
  and current diffusion timescales. Typical values: 0.5-1.5, with $l_i \sim 0.8$ for
  steady-state profiles.'
