description: Minor radius of plasma boundary.
documentation: |-
  Minor radius $a$ of the plasma boundary, defined as half the radial extent: $a = (R_{max} - R_{min})/2$ where $R_{max}$ and $R_{min}$ are the outermost and innermost major radius values of the boundary contour. This fundamental geometric quantity characterizes the plasma size.

  Governing equation:
  $$a = \frac{R_{max} - R_{min}}{2}$$

  where $R_{max}$ and $R_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum major radius coordinates of the plasma boundary contour.

  Physical significance: This quantity characterizes the plasma size parameter used in normalized plasma parameters and scaling laws. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis. The minor radius affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q \propto B_{tor} R_0 / B_{pol} a$ and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through aspect ratio effects.

  Larger minor radius improves confinement through increased plasma volume but requires stronger magnetic fields for stable operation. Critical for [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits through $\beta \propto a^2 B^2 / R_0$ and affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through scaling laws. The minor radius determines the effective plasma size and affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  For shaped plasmas with elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$, the minor radius represents the equivalent circular radius that would give the same cross-sectional area. The actual flux surface shape affects transport through geometric factors in [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $a \approx 2.0$ m. JET: $1.0$ m. DIII-D: $0.67$ m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric half-width of plasma boundary.
