name: poloidal_flux_derivative_with_respect_to_toroidal_flux_coordinate
description: Radial derivative of poloidal flux with respect to toroidal flux coordinate.
documentation: Derivative $d\psi/d\rho_{tor}$ relating poloidal flux to toroidal flux
  coordinate changes. Used in flux coordinate transformations and transport calculations.
  Related to safety factor through $q = (d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi)(d\psi/d\rho_{tor})^{-1}(d\Phi_{tor}/d\rho_{tor})^{-1}$.
