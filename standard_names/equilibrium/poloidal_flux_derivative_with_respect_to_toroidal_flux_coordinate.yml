documentation: |-
  Derivative $d\psi/d\rho_{tor}$ relating poloidal flux to toroidal flux coordinate changes. This fundamental quantity characterizes the relationship between flux coordinates in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{d\psi}{d\rho_{tor}} = \frac{d}{d\rho_{tor}} \oint_{\text{surface}} \mathbf{B}_{pol} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$


  where $\psi$ is the poloidal flux and $\rho_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux coordinate.


  Physical significance: This quantity relates poloidal flux to toroidal flux coordinate changes. Used in flux coordinate transformations and transport calculations. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Related to [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through $q = (d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi)(d\psi/d\rho_{tor})^{-1}(d\Phi_{tor}/d\rho_{tor})^{-1}$. The derivative affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through coordinate transformations and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations through flux surface geometry.

  Critical for accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space. The derivative determines the relationship between normalized flux coordinates and affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux coordinate geometry and magnetic field topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $d\psi/d\rho_{tor} \approx 1-5$ Wb/m across plasma radius. JET: $0.5-3$ Wb/m. DIII-D: $0.3-2$ Wb/m. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive when poloidal flux increases with toroidal flux coordinate.
