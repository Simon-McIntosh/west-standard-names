name: flux_surface_averaged_upper_triangularity
description: Radial profile of flux surface averaged upper triangularity.
documentation: Flux surface averaged upper triangularity $\langle \delta_{upper} \rangle$
  with respect to magnetic axis. Measures D-shape character of upper half of flux
  surfaces. Average over flux surface of local upper triangularity. Used for shape
  optimization and MHD stability analysis.
