description: Major radius of primary strike point location.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the primary strike point where the separatrix intersects the divertor target plate. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the radial location of heat and particle flux on divertor surfaces.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{strike} = \text{major radius of primary strike point}$$

  where $R_{strike}$ is the radial coordinate of the strike point on the divertor target.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the radial location where field lines from the confined plasma first contact material surfaces. Strike point is where field lines from the confined plasma first contact material surfaces. Essential for [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) and plasma-wall interaction analysis.

  The strike point radial position determines heat and particle flux distribution on divertor tiles and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  For double-null configurations, primary strike point is at the more active X-point. The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings, typically located at larger major radius than the X-point due to field line connection.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and divertor target geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{strike} \approx 8.7$ m for lower single-null. JET: $3.8$ m. DIII-D: $2.4$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and X-point location.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
