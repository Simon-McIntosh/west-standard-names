description: Major radius of primary strike point location.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the primary strike point where
  the separatrix intersects the divertor target plate. Strike point is where field
  lines from the confined plasma first contact material surfaces. Location determines
  heat and particle flux distribution on divertor tiles. For double-null, primary
  strike point is at the more active X-point.
