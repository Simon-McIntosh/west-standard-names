name: radial_position_of_magnetic_axis
description: Major radius of magnetic axis location.
documentation: 'Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the magnetic axis where $\mathbf{B}_{pol}
  = 0$ and $|\mathbf{B}|$ is maximum. Innermost point of nested flux surfaces defining
  plasma geometric center. Shafranov shift moves magnetic axis outward from geometric
  axis due to finite pressure and current. Typical shift: 5-15 cm in medium-size tokamaks.'
