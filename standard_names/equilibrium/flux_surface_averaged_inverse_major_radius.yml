name: flux_surface_averaged_inverse_major_radius
description: Flux surface average of inverse major radius.
documentation: Flux surface averaged $\langle 1/R \rangle$. Geometric moment related
  to toroidal effects and 1/R weighting. Used in neoclassical theory for toroidal
  corrections and trapped particle physics. Appears in bootstrap current and rotation
  damping calculations.
