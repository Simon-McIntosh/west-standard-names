description: Flux surface averaged inverse major radius.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged $\langle 1/R \rangle$. Fundamental geometric moment (gm1) capturing 1/R weighting effects from toroidal geometry. Critical for neoclassical transport theory and trapped particle physics.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle 1/R \rangle = \frac{\oint (1/R) / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  Physical significance: This quantity appears in the grad-B drift velocity and determines trapped particle behavior. Essential for calculating neoclassical transport coefficients and bootstrap current. Related to [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) through the $1/R$ field variation and [reference_major_radius_of_vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field](#reference_major_radius_of_vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field) normalization.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as gm1 geometric moment. Used in [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) formulations.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle 1/R \rangle \approx 0.1-0.3$ m$^{-1}$ across plasma radius. JET: $0.05-0.4$ m$^{-1}$. DIII-D: $0.08-0.35$ m$^{-1}$. Values decrease from core to edge due to increasing flux surface area.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric averaging weight.
