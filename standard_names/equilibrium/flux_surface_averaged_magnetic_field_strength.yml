name: flux_surface_averaged_magnetic_field_strength
description: Flux surface averaged magnetic field strength (obsolescent).
documentation: Flux surface averaged magnetic field magnitude $\langle B \rangle$.
  **Note:** This quantity is marked as obsolescent in IMAS Data Dictionary version
  3.5.0. For neoclassical calculations, use geometric moments gm4 and gm5 instead.
  Historically used for field strength characterization.
