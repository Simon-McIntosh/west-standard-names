description: Flux surface averaged magnetic field strength (obsolescent).
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged magnetic field magnitude $\langle B \rangle$. **Note:** This quantity is marked as obsolescent in IMAS Data Dictionary version 3.5.0. For neoclassical calculations, use geometric moments gm4 and gm5 instead. Historically used for field strength characterization.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle B \rangle = \frac{\oint B / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  where $B$ is the magnetic field magnitude and the integral is taken around the flux surface.

  Physical significance: This quantity was historically used for field strength characterization and appears in some transport calculations. However, it has been superseded by more sophisticated geometric moments like [flux_surface_averaged_squared_magnetic_field_strength](#flux_surface_averaged_squared_magnetic_field_strength) (gm4) and [flux_surface_averaged_inverse_squared_magnetic_field_strength](#flux_surface_averaged_inverse_squared_magnetic_field_strength) (gm5) for neoclassical transport theory. The simple average $\langle B \rangle$ does not capture the full physics of magnetic field variation on flux surfaces.

  For modern neoclassical transport calculations, the geometric moments gm4 = $\langle B^2 \rangle$ and gm5 = $\langle 1/B^2 \rangle$ provide more accurate representations of magnetic field effects on particle orbits and transport. These quantities are essential for [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) formulations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using magnetic field geometry. Available from IMAS equilibrium IDS but marked as obsolescent. For current applications, use gm4 and gm5 geometric moments instead.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle B \rangle \approx 2-6$ T across plasma radius. JET: $1-4$ T. DIII-D: $0.8-2.5$ T. Values decrease from core to edge following toroidal field $1/R$ variation.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing magnetic field magnitude averaged over flux surface.
