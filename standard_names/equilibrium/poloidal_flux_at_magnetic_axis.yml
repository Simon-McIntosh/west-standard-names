description: Poloidal flux at magnetic axis location.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic flux $\psi_{axis}$ at the magnetic axis where poloidal field vanishes. This fundamental quantity represents the minimum value of poloidal flux function in the confined region of tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\psi_{axis} = \oint_{\text{axis}} \mathbf{B}_{pol} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$


  where the integral is taken over any surface bounded by the magnetic axis and $\mathbf{B}_{pol}$ is the poloidal magnetic field.


  Physical significance: This quantity represents the minimum value of poloidal flux function in confined region. Used to normalize flux coordinates: $\psi_{norm} = (\psi - \psi_{axis})/(\psi_{boundary} - \psi_{axis})$. Essential reference value in Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solution and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  The poloidal flux at magnetic axis affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through coordinate normalization and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through equilibrium forces. Critical for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. The quantity affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations through flux coordinate definitions.

  Essential reference value in Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solution. The difference $\psi_{boundary} - \psi_{axis}$ represents the total poloidal flux swing between the axis and the plasma boundary, which determines the enclosed plasma current through Ampère's law.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using magnetic field geometry and flux surface topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as equilibrium quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $\psi_{axis} \approx -5$ to $-2$ Wb. JET: $-2$ to $-1$ Wb. DIII-D: $-1$ to $-0.5$ Wb. Values vary with plasma current and magnetic field configuration.

  Sign convention: Positive when poloidal flux increases from magnetic axis toward plasma boundary.
