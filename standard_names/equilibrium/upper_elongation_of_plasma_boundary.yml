name: upper_elongation_of_plasma_boundary
description: Upper half elongation of plasma boundary.
documentation: Elongation $\kappa_{upper}$ of upper half of plasma boundary relative
  to geometric axis. Defined as $(Z_{max} - Z_{axis})/(R_{max} - R_{min})$ where $Z_{axis}$
  is the geometric axis height. Asymmetry between upper and lower elongation indicates
  vertical asymmetry in plasma shape.
