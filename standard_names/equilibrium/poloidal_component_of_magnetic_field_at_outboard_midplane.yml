description: Poloidal magnetic field strength at outboard midplane.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic field magnitude $B_{pol}(\rho)$ at outboard midplane. Generated by toroidal plasma current: $B_{pol} \propto I_p/a$. Decreases with minor radius outside current channel. Related to safety factor: $q \propto B_{tor}/B_{pol}$. Low edge $B_{pol}$ indicates high $q_{edge}$ favorable for stability.

  Governing equation:
  $$B_{pol}(\rho) = \frac{\mu_0 I_p(\rho)}{2\pi a}$$

  where $I_p(\rho)$ is the plasma current enclosed within radius $\rho$ and $a$ is the minor radius.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through the relationship $q \propto B_{tor}/B_{pol}$. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis as low edge $B_{pol}$ indicates high $q_{edge}$ favorable for stability. Related to [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) through force balance. Essential for magnetic equilibrium reconstruction and tokamak operation.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction determines $B_{pol}$ profiles from magnetic diagnostics. [Poloidal_magnetic_field_probe](#Poloidal_magnetic_field_probe) arrays provide local measurements. Faraday rotation diagnostics constrain $B_{pol}$ profiles. Edge $B_{pol}$ critical for kink instability and tearing mode stability analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $B_{pol} \approx 0.2-2.0$ T across radius. JET: $0.1-1.5$ T. DIII-D: $0.1-1.2$ T. Peak values at magnetic axis, decreasing toward edge. Edge $B_{pol}$ typically 0.1-0.3 T for stable operation.

  Sign convention: Positive when pointing in direction of increasing $Z$ (upward) at outboard midplane.
