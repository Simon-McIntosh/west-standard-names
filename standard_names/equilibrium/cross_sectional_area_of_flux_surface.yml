description: Poloidal cross-sectional area enclosed by flux surface.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal cross-sectional area $A(\rho)$ enclosed by a flux surface at radial position $\rho$, calculated as the area bounded by the flux surface contour in the $(R,Z)$ poloidal plane.

  Governing equation:
  $$A(\rho) = \oint_{\text{contour}} \frac{1}{2} (R \, dZ - Z \, dR)$$

  where the integral is taken around the closed flux surface contour in the poloidal plane.

  Physical significance: This quantity is fundamental for calculating volume-averaged plasma parameters and appears in the relationship $V = 2\pi R_{\text{geom}} A$ for toroidal geometry, where $R_{\text{geom}}$ is the geometric center major radius. The cross-sectional area determines the local plasma cross-section and affects [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) calculations through the relationship $\beta = 2\mu_0 \langle p \rangle / B_0^2$. Essential for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations.

  For circular cross-sections, $A = \pi a^2$ where $a$ is the minor radius. For shaped plasmas with elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$, the area must be calculated by integrating over the actual flux surface boundary. Elongation increases area for fixed minor radius, while triangularity has a more complex effect depending on the specific shape.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [flux_surface_volume](#flux_surface_volume) calculations and [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) determination. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $A \approx 10-50$ m$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $3-15$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $1-8$ m$^2$. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion. Peak values at plasma boundary typically 30-50 m$^2$ for ITER-scale devices.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric area enclosed by flux surface.
