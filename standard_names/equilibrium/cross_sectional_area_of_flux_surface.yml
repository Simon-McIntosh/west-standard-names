description: Poloidal cross-sectional area enclosed by flux surface.
documentation: 'Poloidal cross-sectional area $A(\rho)$ enclosed by a flux surface
  at radial position $\rho$, calculated as the area bounded by the flux surface contour
  in the $(R,Z)$ poloidal plane.


  For circular cross-sections, $A = \pi a^2$ where $a$ is the minor radius. For shaped
  plasmas, the area must be calculated by integrating over the actual flux surface
  boundary.


  This quantity is used in calculating volume-averaged plasma parameters and appears
  in the relationship $V = 2\pi R_{geom} A$ for toroidal geometry, where $R_{geom}$
  is the geometric center major radius.'
