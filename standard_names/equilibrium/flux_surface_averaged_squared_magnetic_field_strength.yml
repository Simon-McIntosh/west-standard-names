description: Flux surface averaged squared magnetic field strength.
documentation: |-
  Flux surface averaged magnetic field magnitude squared $\langle B^2 \rangle$. Geometric moment (gm4) capturing magnetic energy density weighting from toroidal field variation. Critical for MHD equilibrium analysis and neoclassical transport theory.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle B^2 \rangle = \frac{\oint B^2 / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  Physical significance: This quantity represents magnetic energy density averaged over flux surfaces. Related to [magnetic_pressure](#magnetic_pressure) and appears in force balance calculations. Essential for [mhd_equilibrium](#mhd_equilibrium) analysis and connects to [vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field_at_reference_major_radius](#vacuum_toroidal_magnetic_field_at_reference_major_radius) through toroidal field variation $B_{tor}(R) = B_0 R_0 / R$.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction combining toroidal and poloidal field contributions. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as gm4 geometric moment. Used in pressure balance relations and magnetic confinement analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle B^2 \rangle \approx 10-50$ T$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $5-25$ T$^2$. DIII-D: $3-15$ T$^2$. Values decrease from core to edge following toroidal field $1/R$ variation.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing magnetic energy density.
