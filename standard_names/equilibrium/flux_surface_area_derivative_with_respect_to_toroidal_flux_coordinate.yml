  flux coordinate.
documentation: |-
  Radial derivative $dA/d\rho_{tor}$ of poloidal cross-sectional area with respect to toroidal flux coordinate. This geometric quantity relates toroidal flux coordinates to cross-sectional area in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dA}{d\rho_{tor}} = \frac{d}{d\rho_{tor}} \oint_{\text{contour}} \frac{1}{2} (R \, dZ - Z \, dR)$$

  where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $\rho_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity is used in transport codes for geometry factors in diffusion and convection terms. Related to volume derivative through flux surface geometry via $dV/d\rho_{tor} = A(\rho_{tor})$. Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [transport_modeling](#transport_modeling).

  The derivative $dA/d\rho_{tor}$ represents the rate of change of cross-sectional area with respect to the toroidal flux coordinate. In circular geometry, this derivative is approximately constant, but in shaped plasmas it varies significantly with flux surface shape and position. This quantity is particularly important for accurate transport modeling and equilibrium reconstruction in non-circular tokamak equilibria.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry and toroidal flux coordinate values. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for accurate mapping between toroidal flux coordinates and physical space.

  Typical values: ITER: $dA/d\rho_{tor} \approx 10-50$ m across plasma radius. JET: $3-15$ m. DIII-D: $1-8$ m. Values increase from core to edge following flux surface expansion and geometric effects.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric area change with toroidal flux coordinate.
