name: current_profile
description: Spatial profile of plasma current density across flux surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Current density profile $j(\rho)$ across normalized flux surfaces describing the distribution of toroidal plasma current. This fundamental physical quantity determines the spatial distribution of current flow in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$j(\rho) = \frac{dI_{enc}(\rho)}{dA_{\text{pol}}}$$

  where $I_{enc}(\rho)$ is the enclosed plasma current and $A_{\text{pol}}$ is the poloidal cross-sectional area.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profile $q(\rho)$ and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability), transport, and confinement. Peaked profiles with low edge current favor stability but may reduce [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  Broad profiles improve [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) fraction but may trigger instabilities. Critical for tokamak operation scenarios and control system design. The current profile affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors and influences [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through profile effects.

  Measured by polarimetry and MSE, or reconstructed from magnetic diagnostics. The profile shape significantly impacts [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) - peaked profiles with low edge current favor stability. Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [current_profile_control](#current_profile_control).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_diagnostics](#magnetic_diagnostics) provide boundary conditions and constraints. [Polarimetry](#polarimetry) and [motional_stark_effect](#motional_stark_effect) provide local current density measurements. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction inverts magnetic measurements to determine current profiles. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and transport modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $j \approx 0.5-5$ MA/m$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $0.2-3$ MA/m$^2$. DIII-D: $0.3-4$ MA/m$^2$. Peak values at magnetic axis, decreasing toward edge. Profile shape varies with heating and current drive methods.

  Sign convention: Positive when current flows in toroidal direction (counter-clockwise viewing from above).
