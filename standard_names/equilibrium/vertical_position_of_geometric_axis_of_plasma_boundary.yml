name: vertical_position_of_geometric_axis_of_plasma_boundary
description: Height of geometric center of plasma boundary.
documentation: Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the geometric axis of the plasma
  boundary, defined as $(Z_{min} + Z_{max})/2$ where $Z_{min}$ and $Z_{max}$ are the
  lowest and highest vertical positions of the boundary contour. Together with radial
  position forms the reference point for plasma shape characterization.
