description: Reference major radius where vacuum toroidal magnetic field is specified.
documentation: 'Reference major radius $R_0$ at which the vacuum toroidal magnetic
  field $B_0$ is specified. This is typically a fixed geometric location such as the
  middle of the vessel at the equatorial midplane.


  The toroidal field varies as $B_{tor}(R) \approx B_0 R_0 / R$ in vacuum (for large
  aspect ratio). The choice of reference radius $R_0$ is a convention that must be
  consistent across all calculations using $B_0$.


  This parameter is used in defining the toroidal flux coordinate:


  $$\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\frac{\Phi}{\pi B_0}}$$


  and in normalizing current densities.'
