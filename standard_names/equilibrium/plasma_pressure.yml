name: plasma_pressure
description: Plasma pressure including thermal and fast particle contributions.
documentation: |-
  Total plasma pressure $p(\rho)$ including thermal electrons, ions, and fast particle contributions. Fundamental force balance parameter determining [MHD_equilibrium](#MHD_equilibrium) and plasma confinement. Key input for Grad-Shafranov equation and determines Shafranov shift.

  Governing equation:
  $$p(\rho) = \sum_s n_s T_s + p_{fast}$$

  where $n_s$ and $T_s$ are density and temperature for species $s$, and $p_{fast}$ is fast particle pressure.

  Physical significance: Plasma pressure drives [MHD_stability](#MHD_stability) through [ballooning_mode](#ballooning_mode) and [kink_instability](#kink_instability) limits. Pressure gradients generate [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) and affect [toroidal_current_density](#toroidal_current_density) profiles. Related to [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta): $\beta = 2\mu_0 \langle p \rangle / B_0^2$. Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) measures electron pressure from $n_e T_e$ product. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) provides ion temperature for $n_i T_i$ calculation. [Diamagnetic_loop](#Diamagnetic_loop) measures pressure indirectly through diamagnetic flux. Pressure profiles determined from kinetic measurements and [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) analysis.

  Typical values: Tokamak core plasmas: 0.1-10 MPa. ITER: 1-8 MPa. JET: 0.5-6 MPa. DIII-D: 0.3-4 MPa. Pressure profiles typically peaked on-axis with gradient scale length 0.2-0.4 m. Edge pressure typically 10-100 kPa.

  Sign convention: Positive pressure indicates compressive force, following standard thermodynamics.
