description: Weight assigned to Faraday angle measurement in reconstruction cost function.
documentation: Weight assigned to Faraday rotation angle measurement in equilibrium
  reconstruction algorithm. Controls relative influence of polarimetry diagnostic
  compared to other measurements (flux loops, magnetic probes) in determining final
  equilibrium solution.
