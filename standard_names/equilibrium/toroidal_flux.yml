description: Radial profile of toroidal magnetic flux.
documentation: 'Toroidal magnetic flux $\Phi_{tor}(\rho)$ enclosed within flux surface.
  Related to poloidal flux via safety factor: $q = d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$. Used to define
  toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor} = \sqrt{\Phi_{tor}/\pi B_0}$. Monotonically
  increasing from axis to boundary with $\Phi_{tor,axis} = 0$.'
