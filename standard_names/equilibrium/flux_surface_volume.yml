name: flux_surface_volume
description: Volume enclosed within flux surface.
documentation: |-
  Volume $V(\rho)$ enclosed within flux surface at radial position $\rho$, representing the total volume of plasma contained within that flux surface.

  Governing equation:
  $$V(\rho) = \iiint_{\text{flux surface}} dV = \int_{\psi_{\text{min}}}^{\psi} A(\psi') \, d\psi'$$

  where $A(\psi')$ is the cross-sectional area at flux coordinate $\psi'$ and the relationship $dV/d\rho = A(\rho)$ holds for certain coordinate choices.

  Physical significance: This quantity is fundamental for calculating volume-averaged quantities and particle content. Used in [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) calculations and affects [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) determination through $\beta = 2\mu_0 \langle p \rangle / B_0^2$. Essential for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) calculations.

  For circular cross-section: $V \approx 2\pi^2 R_0 a^2$ where $R_0$ is major radius and $a$ is minor radius. Elongation and triangularity increase volume for given minor radius through shape effects. The volume affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through flux surface expansion and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma size effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization and [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $V \approx 100-800$ m$^3$ across plasma radius. JET: $50-200$ m$^3$. DIII-D: $10-80$ m$^3$. Values increase significantly from core to edge following flux surface expansion. Peak values at plasma boundary typically 500-800 m$^3$ for ITER-scale devices.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric volume enclosed by flux surface.
