name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_diamagnetic_current_density
description: Parallel diamagnetic current density from pressure anisotropy and curvature
  drifts.
documentation: Flux surface averaged parallel diamagnetic current density arising
  from pressure anisotropy and curvature drifts. Perpendicular pressure gradient drives
  $\mathbf{j}_\perp = \mathbf{B} \times \nabla p / B^2$. Parallel projection contributes
  to equilibrium current balance. Related to Pfirsch-Schlüter current in toroidal
  geometry.
