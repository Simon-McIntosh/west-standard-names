description: Toroidal beta parameter for plasma pressure.
documentation: 'Toroidal beta $\beta_t$ measuring ratio of plasma pressure to toroidal
  magnetic field pressure. Defined as $\beta_t = \frac{2 \mu_0}{V B_0^2} \int p \,
  dV$ where $B_0$ is vacuum toroidal field and $V$ is plasma volume. Fundamental figure
  of merit for fusion performance. Typical values: 1-5% in conventional tokamaks,
  up to 10-15% in advanced scenarios.'
