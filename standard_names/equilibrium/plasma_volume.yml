name: plasma_volume
description: Total volume enclosed by plasma boundary.
documentation: "Total plasma volume $V$ enclosed by the plasma boundary surface. For\
  \ axisymmetric toroidal plasma: $V = \\int 2\\pi R \\, dA$ integrated over poloidal\
  \ cross-section area. Used in global energy balance, beta calculations, and fusion\
  \ power scaling. Typical values: 10-1000 m\xB3 depending on device size."
