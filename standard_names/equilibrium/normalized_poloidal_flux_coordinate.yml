description: Normalized poloidal flux coordinate for radial position in flux coordinates.
documentation: 'Normalized poloidal flux coordinate $\rho_{pol,norm}$ defined as:


  $$\rho_{pol,norm} = \sqrt{\frac{\psi - \psi_{axis}}{\psi_{LCFS} - \psi_{axis}}}$$


  where $\psi$ is the poloidal magnetic flux, $\psi_{axis}$ is the flux at the magnetic
  axis, and $\psi_{LCFS}$ is the flux at the last closed flux surface (plasma boundary).


  This coordinate varies from 0 at the magnetic axis to 1 at the plasma boundary.
  It provides an alternative radial coordinate to $\rho_{tor,norm}$ and is particularly
  useful for equilibrium reconstruction and MHD analysis.'
