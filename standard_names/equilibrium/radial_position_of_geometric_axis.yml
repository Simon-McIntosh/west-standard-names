description: Radial profile of geometric major radius of flux surfaces.
documentation: Geometric major radius $R_{geo}(\rho) = (R_{inboard} + R_{outboard})/2$
  defining flux surface center. Increases with radius due to Shafranov shift from
  pressure and current. Used for approximate geometric calculations and profile mapping.
  Differs from flux surface averaged $\langle R \rangle$ by $O(\epsilon^2)$ corrections.
