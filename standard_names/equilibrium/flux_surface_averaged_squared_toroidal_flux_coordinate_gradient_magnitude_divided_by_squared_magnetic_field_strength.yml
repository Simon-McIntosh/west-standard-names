name: flux_surface_averaged_squared_toroidal_flux_coordinate_gradient_magnitude_divided_by_squared_magnetic_field_strength
description: Flux surface average of squared gradient magnitude divided by squared
  field strength.
documentation: Flux surface averaged geometric moment $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2
  / B^2 \rangle$. Metric coefficient in drift kinetic and gyrokinetic theories. Appears
  in parallel transport calculations and field line curvature effects. Essential for
  neoclassical transport modeling.
