  Flux surface averaged geometric moment $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / B^2 \rangle$. This metric coefficient appears in drift kinetic and gyrokinetic theories for tokamak plasma modeling.

  Governing equation:
  $$\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / B^2 \rangle = \frac{\oint (|\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / B^2) / |\nabla \rho| d\theta}{\oint 1/|\nabla \rho| d\theta}$$

  where $\rho_{tor}$ is the toroidal flux coordinate and $B$ is the magnetic field strength.

  Physical significance: This quantity appears in parallel transport calculations and field line curvature effects. Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) modeling and drift kinetic theory. Critical for accurate [gyrokinetic](#gyrokinetic) simulations and [turbulence](#turbulence) analysis. The metric coefficient affects particle orbits and transport in toroidal geometry.

  This geometric moment is particularly important for understanding trapped particle behavior and banana orbit width calculations. It influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) formulations through neoclassical transport theory and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through kinetic effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using complete magnetic field geometry and flux coordinate gradients. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric moment. Used in [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and [gyrokinetic](#gyrokinetic) code inputs.

  Typical values: ITER: $\langle |\nabla \rho_{tor}|^2 / B^2 \rangle \approx 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ T$^{-2}$ across plasma radius. JET: $10^{-3}-5 \times 10^{-3}$ T$^{-2}$. DIII-D: $5 \times 10^{-4}-3 \times 10^{-3}$ T$^{-2}$. Values typically decrease from core to edge due to magnetic field variation.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric weighting for drift kinetic calculations.
