description: Toroidal magnetic field component at magnetic axis.
documentation: Toroidal magnetic field component $B_{tor}$ at the magnetic axis location.
  Maximum value of toroidal field in plasma due to $1/R$ dependence. Related to vacuum
  field by $B_{tor}(R_{axis}) = B_0 R_0 / R_{axis}$ where $R_0$ is reference radius.
  Used for calculating on-axis safety factor and plasma parameters.
