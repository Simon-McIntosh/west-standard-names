name: f_multiplied_by_poloidal_flux_derivative_of_f
description: Radial profile of F function multiplied by derivative of F with respect
  to poloidal flux.
documentation: Profile of $F(\psi) F'(\psi)$ where $F = R B_{tor}$ is poloidal current
  function and $F' = dF/d\psi$. Appears in Grad-Shafranov equation source term representing
  toroidal field contribution. Related to toroidal plasma current and bootstrap current.
  Negative $F F'$ corresponds to paramagnetic toroidal current.
