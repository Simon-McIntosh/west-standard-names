description: F function multiplied by derivative of F with respect to poloidal flux.
documentation: |-
  Profile of $F(\psi) F'(\psi)$ where $F = R B_{tor}$ is poloidal current function and $F' = dF/d\psi$. This fundamental quantity appears in the Grad-Shafranov equation source term representing toroidal field contribution in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$F F' = R B_{tor} \frac{d}{d\psi}(R B_{tor})$$

  where $F = R B_{tor}$ is the poloidal current function and $\psi$ is the poloidal flux.

  Physical significance: This quantity appears in Grad-Shafranov equation source term representing toroidal field contribution. Related to toroidal plasma current and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current). Essential for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Negative $F F'$ corresponds to paramagnetic toroidal current. The quantity affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through equilibrium forces and influences [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through current distribution. Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  The $F F'$ profile determines the toroidal current density through $\mu_0 j_{tor} = R \frac{d}{dR}(F F')/R + \frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dR}(F F')$. This relationship is essential for [current_profile](#current_profile) calculations and affects [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients).

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using magnetic field geometry and flux surface topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as equilibrium quantity. Used in [mhd_equilibrium](#mhd_equilibrium) analysis and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: $F F' \approx -10$ to $10$ T$^2$/Wb across plasma radius. JET: $-5$ to $5$ T$^2$/Wb. DIII-D: $-3$ to $3$ T$^2$/Wb. Values vary with plasma current and pressure profiles.

  Sign convention: Positive when $F$ and $F'$ have same sign, negative when opposite signs.
