name: position_of_plasma_boundary_outline
description: Position vector contour defining plasma boundary shape.
documentation: Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ defining the closed contour
  of the plasma boundary in cylindrical coordinates. Array of position vectors forming
  the poloidal outline of the last closed flux surface. Used in equilibrium codes
  to define computational domain boundary or as constraint for free-boundary reconstruction.
