name: position_of_magnetic_axis
description: Position vector of magnetic axis.
documentation: Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the magnetic axis in cylindrical
  coordinates. Defines the point where $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$ and flux surfaces are
  centered. Fundamental reference point for flux coordinate systems and plasma equilibrium
  characterization.
