description: MHD equilibrium state of magnetized plasma in tokamak configuration.
documentation: |-
  Magnetic equilibrium representing the force balance state where plasma pressure gradients are balanced by Lorentz forces: $\nabla p = \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{B}$. In tokamaks, this results in nested flux surfaces with nested magnetic topology. Equilibrium is described by the Grad-Shafranov equation and characterized by profiles of plasma current, pressure, and magnetic field. Essential for interpreting diagnostic measurements and predicting plasma behavior. Reconstruction uses magnetic sensors, interferometry, and kinetic profiles to solve for equilibrium parameters. Affects all transport calculations and stability analysis.

  Governing equation:
  $$\nabla p = \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{B}$$

  where $p$ is plasma pressure, $\mathbf{j}$ is current density, and $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field.

  Physical significance: This quantity determines [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) boundaries and affects all plasma behavior. Equilibrium profiles control [safety_factor](#safety_factor), [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current), and [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients). Critical for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization. Related to [plasma_pressure](#plasma_pressure), [plasma_current](#plasma_current), and [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field). Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and predictive modeling.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Magnetic_diagnostics](#Magnetic_diagnostics) provide boundary conditions and constraints. [Interferometry](#interferometry) measures [electron_density](#electron_density) profiles. [Thomson_scattering](#thomson_scattering) provides kinetic profiles. [Charge_exchange_spectroscopy](#charge_exchange_spectroscopy) contributes ion temperature data. Equilibrium codes solve Grad-Shafranov equation using these inputs. Critical for [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) analysis and transport modeling.

  Typical values: ITER: Major radius $R_0 = 6.2$ m, minor radius $a = 2.0$ m, elongation $\kappa = 1.7-1.9$. JET: $R_0 = 3.0$ m, $a = 1.0$ m, $\kappa = 1.6-1.8$. DIII-D: $R_0 = 1.7$ m, $a = 0.67$ m, $\kappa = 1.8-2.0$. Equilibrium parameters determine confinement quality and operational limits.
