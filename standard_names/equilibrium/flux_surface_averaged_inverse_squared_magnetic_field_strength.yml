name: flux_surface_averaged_inverse_squared_magnetic_field_strength
description: Flux surface average of inverse squared magnetic field strength.
documentation: Flux surface averaged $\langle 1/B^2 \rangle$. Geometric moment appearing
  in neoclassical transport coefficients and bootstrap current calculations. Important
  for trapped particle fraction and banana orbit width. Used in Sauter bootstrap current
  formula.
