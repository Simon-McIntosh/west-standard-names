name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_adiabatic_electron_current_density
description: Parallel adiabatic electron current density from pressure gradient.
documentation: 'Flux surface averaged parallel current density from adiabatic electron
  response: $j_{\parallel,e} = -n_e e (T_e/eB) \nabla_{\parallel} \ln p_e$. Pressure-gradient
  driven current arising from electron compressibility along field lines. Contributes
  to Pfirsch-Schlüter current in neoclassical theory. Small compared to Ohmic and
  bootstrap currents.'
