description: Toroidal surface area of flux surfaces.
documentation: |-
  Surface area $S(\rho)$ of toroidal flux surface representing the total surface area of the nested toroidal flux surface.

  Governing equation:
  $$S(\rho) = \oint_{\text{poloidal}} 2\pi R \, dl_{\text{pol}}$$

  where the integral is taken around the poloidal circumference and $R$ is the major radius coordinate.

  Physical significance: This quantity is used in particle balance and plasma-wall interaction calculations. Related to volume through $dV/d\rho = S$ for certain coordinate choices. Larger surface area increases plasma-wall interaction and affects [particle_confinement_time](#particle_confinement_time). Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) and [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations. Critical for understanding [plasma-wall_interaction](#plasma-wall_interaction) physics and [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics).

  For axisymmetric plasma, the surface area is calculated by integrating $2\pi R$ times the poloidal arc length element around the flux surface. The surface area affects the [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through connection length calculations and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through surface-to-volume ratio effects. Shaping parameters including elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$ significantly increase the surface area compared to circular cross-sections.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using complete flux surface geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [flux_surface_volume](#flux_surface_volume) integration and [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) calculations. Essential for [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) planning and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: $S \approx 100-1000$ m$^2$ across plasma radius. JET: $30-300$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $15-150$ m$^2$. Values increase significantly from core to edge due to geometric expansion. Peak values at plasma boundary typically 500-1000 m$^2$ for ITER-scale devices.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing total toroidal surface area of flux surface.
