name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_current_density
description: Flux surface averaged parallel plasma current density.
documentation: 'Flux surface averaged parallel current density $\langle j_{\parallel}
  \rangle$ flowing along magnetic field lines. Sum of Ohmic, bootstrap, and beam/RF-driven
  currents. Related to safety factor: $q = d\Phi_{tor}/d\psi$ and current profile
  shape affects stability. Peaked profiles with low edge current favor stability.'
