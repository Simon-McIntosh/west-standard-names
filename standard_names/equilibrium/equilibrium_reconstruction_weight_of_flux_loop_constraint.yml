description: Weight assigned to flux loop measurement in reconstruction cost function.
documentation: Weight assigned to flux loop measurement in equilibrium reconstruction
  algorithm. Controls relative importance of this flux loop compared to other diagnostics
  in minimizing reconstruction cost function $J = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i w_i^2 (\Phi_{recon,i}
  - \Phi_{meas,i})^2 / \sigma_i^2$.
