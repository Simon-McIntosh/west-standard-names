description: Normalized toroidal flux at minimum safety factor location.
documentation: 'Normalized toroidal flux coordinate $\rho_{tor,norm}$ at the radial
  location where safety factor reaches its minimum value. For monotonic q-profiles:
  $\rho_{q,min} = 0$ (at axis). For reversed shear: $0 < \rho_{q,min} < 1$ indicating
  off-axis minimum. Used to characterize internal transport barrier location.'
