name: radial_position_of_geometric_axis_of_plasma_boundary
description: Major radius of geometric center of plasma boundary.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the geometric axis of the plasma
  boundary, defined as $(R_{min} + R_{max})/2$ where $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ are the
  innermost and outermost radial positions of the boundary contour. Together with
  vertical position forms the geometric center for calculating elongation and triangularity
  shape parameters.
