name: cross_sectional_area_of_plasma_boundary
description: Cross-sectional area of plasma boundary in poloidal plane.
documentation: Poloidal cross-sectional area $A$ of plasma boundary at last closed
  flux surface. Calculated as area enclosed by boundary contour in $(R,Z)$ plane.
  Related to volume by $V = 2\pi R_{geom} A$ for circular cross-sections. Used in
  calculating averaged plasma density and shape factor calculations.
