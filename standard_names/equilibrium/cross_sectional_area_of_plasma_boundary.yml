description: Cross-sectional area of plasma boundary in poloidal plane.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal cross-sectional area $A$ of plasma boundary at last closed flux surface. This fundamental geometric quantity represents the total area enclosed by the plasma boundary contour in the $(R,Z)$ plane.

  Governing equation:
  $$A = \oint_{\text{boundary}} \frac{1}{2} (R \, dZ - Z \, dR)$$

  where the integral is taken around the closed plasma boundary contour in the poloidal plane.

  Physical significance: This quantity represents the cross-sectional area of the last closed flux surface, calculated as area enclosed by boundary contour in $(R,Z)$ plane. Related to volume by $V = 2\pi R_{geom} A$ for circular cross-sections. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The cross-sectional area affects [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) through $\beta = 2\mu_0 \langle p \rangle / B_0^2$ and influences [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through plasma size effects. Critical for [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) calculations and determines the effective plasma size. The area affects [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations and [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) through geometric factors.

  For shaped plasmas with elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$, the cross-sectional area is larger than that of a circular plasma with the same minor radius. The area is used in calculating averaged plasma density and shape factor calculations.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using plasma boundary geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [plasma_volume](#plasma_volume) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis.

  Typical values: ITER: $A \approx 30-50$ m$^2$. JET: $8-15$ m$^2$. DIII-D: $3-8$ m$^2$. Values vary with plasma shaping and operational parameters.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric area enclosed by plasma boundary.
