description: Value of poloidal magnetic flux at the plasma boundary.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic flux $\psi_{boundary}$ at the plasma boundary (last closed flux surface / separatrix).

  This reference value defines the outer boundary of the confined plasma region and is used to normalize the poloidal flux coordinate:

  $$\psi_{norm} = \frac{\psi - \psi_{axis}}{\psi_{boundary} - \psi_{axis}}$$

  For diverted plasmas, this corresponds to the flux at the X-point. For limited plasmas, it is the flux at the limiter contact point. The flux difference $\psi_{boundary} - \psi_{axis}$ determines the total enclosed plasma current.
