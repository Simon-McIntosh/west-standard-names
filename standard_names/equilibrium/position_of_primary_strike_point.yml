description: Position vector of primary strike point.
documentation: |-
  Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the primary strike point in cylindrical coordinates. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the location where the separatrix intersects the divertor target plate in diverted tokamak configurations.

  Governing equation:
  $$\mathbf{r}_{strike} = (R_{strike}, Z_{strike})$$

  where $R_{strike}$ is the major radius and $Z_{strike}$ is the vertical height of the strike point on the divertor target.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the location where field lines from the confined plasma first contact material surfaces, establishing the boundary between private flux region and scrape-off layer. Essential for [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) and plasma-wall interaction analysis. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) optimization.

  The strike point position determines heat and particle flux distribution on divertor tiles and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  In single-null configurations, the primary strike point is the main heat load location. In double-null configurations, it corresponds to the more active X-point (higher power flux). The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and divertor target geometry. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [divertor_physics](#divertor_physics) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $(R, Z) \approx (8.7, -1.5)$ m for lower single-null. JET: $(3.8, -1.2)$ m. DIII-D: $(2.4, -0.8)$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and X-point location.

  Sign convention: Positive when $R$ points outward from tokamak symmetry axis and $Z$ points upward from midplane.
