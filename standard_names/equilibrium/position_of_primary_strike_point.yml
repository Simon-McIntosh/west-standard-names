description: Position vector of primary strike point.
documentation: Two-dimensional position vector $(R, Z)$ of the primary strike point
  in cylindrical coordinates. Defines the location where the separatrix intersects
  the divertor target plate, establishing the boundary between private flux region
  and scrape-off layer. Essential for divertor design and heat flux analysis.
