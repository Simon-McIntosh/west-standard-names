name: flux_surface_volume_derivative_with_respect_to_poloidal_flux
description: Derivative of flux surface volume with respect to poloidal flux.
documentation: Radial derivative $dV/d\psi$ of volume enclosed by flux surface with
  respect to poloidal flux. Related to flux surface area through $dV/d\psi = (dV/d\rho)(d\rho/d\psi)$.
  Used in transport equation formulations and particle balance calculations.
