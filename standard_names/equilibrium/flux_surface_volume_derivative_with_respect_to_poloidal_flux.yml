description: Derivative of flux surface volume with respect to poloidal flux.
documentation: |-
  Radial derivative $dV/d\psi$ of volume enclosed by flux surface with respect to poloidal flux. This geometric quantity relates flux-based coordinates to volume in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$\frac{dV}{d\psi} = \frac{d}{d\psi} \iiint_{\text{flux surface}} dV$$

  where $V$ is the volume and $\psi$ is the poloidal flux.

  Physical significance: This quantity is used in transport equation formulations and particle balance calculations. Related to flux surface area through $dV/d\psi = (dV/d\rho)(d\rho/d\psi)$. Essential for [neoclassical_transport_coefficients](#neoclassical_transport_coefficients) calculations and accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [transport_modeling](#transport_modeling).

  The derivative $dV/d\psi$ represents the rate of change of volume with respect to the poloidal flux coordinate. In circular geometry, this derivative is approximately constant, but in shaped plasmas it varies significantly with flux surface shape and position. This quantity is particularly important for accurate transport modeling and equilibrium reconstruction in non-circular tokamak equilibria.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using flux surface geometry and poloidal flux values. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric derivative. Used in [transport_coefficients](#transport_coefficients) calculations and [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis. Critical for accurate mapping between flux coordinates and physical space.

  Typical values: ITER: $dV/d\psi \approx 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ m$^3$/Wb across plasma radius. JET: $10^{-2}-5 \times 10^{-2}$ m$^3$/Wb. DIII-D: $5 \times 10^{-3}-3 \times 10^{-2}$ m$^3$/Wb. Values typically decrease from core to edge due to geometric expansion effects.

  Sign convention: Positive definite quantity representing geometric volume change with flux coordinate.
