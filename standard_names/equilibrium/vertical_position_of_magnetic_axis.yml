name: vertical_position_of_magnetic_axis
description: Height of magnetic axis location.
documentation: Vertical coordinate (height $Z$) of the magnetic axis. For up-down
  symmetric plasmas, magnetic axis typically near midplane ($Z \approx 0$). Vertical
  asymmetry in shaping or current profile causes vertical displacement. Used for plasma
  vertical position control and equilibrium reconstruction.
