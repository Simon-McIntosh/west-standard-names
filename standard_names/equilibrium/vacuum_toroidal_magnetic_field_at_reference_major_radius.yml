description: Vacuum toroidal magnetic field magnitude at reference major radius.
documentation: 'Vacuum toroidal magnetic field $B_0$ at the reference major radius
  $R_0$. This is the toroidal field that would exist in the absence of plasma.


  Sign convention: Positive $B_0$ corresponds to counter-clockwise toroidal field
  direction when viewed from above the tokamak.


  The product $R_0 B_0$ is approximately conserved along toroidal field lines in vacuum:


  $$B_{tor}(R) \approx \frac{B_0 R_0}{R}$$


  This quantity must be consistent with the toroidal field coil current and the field
  mapping in the TF coil system. Typical values: 1-10 T for tokamaks.'
