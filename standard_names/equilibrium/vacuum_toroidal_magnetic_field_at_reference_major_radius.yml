description: Vacuum toroidal magnetic field magnitude at reference major radius.
documentation: |-
  Vacuum toroidal magnetic field $B_0$ at the reference major radius $R_0$. Used to characterize the vacuum field profile $B_{tor}(R) = B_0 R_0 / R$.

  Governing equation:
  $$B_{tor}(R) = B_0 \frac{R_0}{R}$$

  where $R$ is the major radius coordinate and $R_0$ is the reference major radius.

  Physical significance: This quantity is the fundamental reference parameter for tokamak magnetic field characterization. Determines [toroidal_magnetic_field](#toroidal_magnetic_field) profiles and affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) calculations. Critical for [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction and [tokamak_operation](#tokamak_operation) planning. Related to [plasma_beta](#plasma_beta) limits through magnetic pressure and determines confinement capability. Essential for [flux_coordinate](#flux_coordinate) normalization and [toroidal_flux_coordinate](#toroidal_flux_coordinate) definition.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Measured by magnetic probes in vacuum conditions before plasma operation. [Magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction uses $B_0$ as boundary condition. [Toroidal_field_coil](#toroidal_field_coil) current measurements determine $B_0$ through calibration. Critical parameter for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and operational limit determination. Used in all equilibrium codes as fundamental input parameter.

  Typical values: ITER: $B_0 = 5.3$ T at $R_0 = 6.2$ m. JET: $B_0 = 3.4-3.8$ T at $R_0 = 3.0$ m. DIII-D: $B_0 = 2.2$ T at $R_0 = 1.7$ m. Higher $B_0$ enables higher plasma pressure and better confinement but increases engineering complexity.

  Sign convention: Positive when anti-clockwise viewing from above (positive toroidal angle direction).
