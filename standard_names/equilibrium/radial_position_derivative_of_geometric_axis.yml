name: radial_position_derivative_of_geometric_axis
description: Radial profile of radial derivative of geometric major radius.
documentation: Derivative $dR_{geo}/d\rho$ of flux surface geometric center position.
  Measures Shafranov shift gradient driven by pressure and current profiles. Positive
  values indicate outward shift increasing with radius. Used in equilibrium solvers
  and coordinate transformations. Large gradients can affect transport and stability.
