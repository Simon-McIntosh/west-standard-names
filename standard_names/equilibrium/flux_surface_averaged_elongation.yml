name: flux_surface_averaged_elongation
description: Radial profile of flux surface averaged elongation.
documentation: 'Flux surface averaged elongation $\langle \kappa \rangle$ measuring
  vertical extent. Average of local elongation over flux surface. Related to vertical
  stability: high $\kappa$ improves confinement but requires active control. Typical
  values: 1.5-2.0 in modern tokamaks. Affects beta limit and MHD stability.'
