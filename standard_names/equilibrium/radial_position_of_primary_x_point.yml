name: radial_position_of_primary_x_point
description: Major radius of primary X-point location.
documentation: Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the primary X-point in diverted
  plasma configuration. X-point is the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes
  and separatrix branches intersect. For single-null, this is the only X-point. For
  double-null, primary X-point is typically the more active one (higher power flux).
  Critical for divertor physics and strike point locations.
