description: Major radius of primary X-point location.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius $R$) of the primary X-point in diverted plasma configuration. This fundamental geometric quantity defines the radial location of the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes in tokamak equilibria.

  Governing equation:
  $$R_{X} = \text{major radius of primary X-point}$$

  where $R_{X}$ is the radial coordinate of the magnetic null where $\mathbf{B}_{pol} = 0$.

  Physical significance: This quantity defines the radial location of the magnetic null where poloidal field vanishes and separatrix branches intersect. For single-null, this is the only X-point. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis.

  The X-point radial position determines the divertor configuration (single-null vs double-null) and affects [mhd_stability](#mhd_stability) through boundary conditions. Critical for [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems and determines the effective plasma boundary in diverted configurations. The position affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) through boundary conditions and influences [bootstrap_current](#bootstrap_current) calculations.

  For double-null configurations, primary X-point is typically the more active one (higher power flux). The position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings, typically located at larger major radius than the magnetic axis due to Shafranov shift effects.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Computed from [magnetic_equilibrium](#magnetic_equilibrium) reconstruction using separatrix geometry and magnetic field topology. Available directly from IMAS equilibrium IDS as geometric quantity. Used in [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) analysis and [plasma_position_control](#plasma_position_control) systems.

  Typical values: ITER: $R_{X} \approx 8.5$ m for lower single-null. JET: $3.6$ m. DIII-D: $2.2$ m. Position varies with plasma shaping and control system settings.

  Sign convention: Positive when measured outward from tokamak symmetry axis.
