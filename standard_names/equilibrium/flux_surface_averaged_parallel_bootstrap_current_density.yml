name: flux_surface_averaged_parallel_bootstrap_current_density
description: Flux surface averaged parallel bootstrap current density.
documentation: Flux surface averaged bootstrap current density $\langle j_{bs} \rangle$
  driven by pressure gradient and trapped particles. Neoclassical self-generated current
  scaling as $j_{bs} \propto \beta_{pol} \nabla p$. Can provide 50-80% of plasma current
  in advanced tokamak scenarios. Essential for steady-state operation.
