description: Neutron leakage flux from tokamak plasma to surrounding structures.
documentation: |-
  Neutron leakage flux representing the neutron flux escaping the plasma and penetrating into surrounding tokamak structures and shielding. This flux determines neutron loading on tokamak components, activation levels, and radiation damage in fusion devices. Understanding neutron leakage is crucial for component design, radiation protection, and maintenance planning in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Phi_{leakage} = \Phi_{plasma} \cdot T_{shielding} \cdot \exp(-\Sigma_{attenuation} \cdot d)$$

  where $\Phi_{leakage}$ is leakage flux, $\Phi_{plasma}$ is plasma neutron source, $T_{shielding}$ is transmission coefficient, $\Sigma_{attenuation}$ is macroscopic attenuation cross-section, and $d$ is shielding thickness.

  Physical significance: Neutron leakage flux determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through component loading and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [neutronics](#neutronics) and radiation effects. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [neutron_activation_analysis](#neutron_activation_analysis), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through neutron transport. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and radiation safety.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Neutron detectors measure leakage flux at various locations. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate neutron transport and leakage. Material analysis determines attenuation properties. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses leakage data for component assessment. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Neutron leakage flux 10¹²-10¹⁴ neutrons/m²s at first wall locations. JET: 10¹⁰-10¹² neutrons/m²s depending on configuration. DIII-D: 10⁸-10¹⁰ neutrons/m²s for various positions. Leakage decreases exponentially with shielding thickness. Range across machines: 10⁸-10¹⁴ neutrons/m²s.

  Sign convention: Positive when neutron leakage flux indicates neutron penetration from plasma to surrounding structures.
