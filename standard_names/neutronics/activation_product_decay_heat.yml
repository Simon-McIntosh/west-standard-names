description: Heat generation from radioactive decay of activation products in tokamak
  materials.
documentation: |-
  Activation product decay heat representing the thermal power generated by radioactive decay of neutron-activated materials in tokamak components after shutdown. This decay heat results from the radioactive decay of activation products formed during neutron irradiation, generating heat that must be managed for safe component handling and disposal. Understanding decay heat is crucial for maintenance planning and radiological safety in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$P_{decay} = \sum_i A_i \cdot E_i \cdot \lambda_i \cdot e^{-\lambda_i t}$$

  where $P_{decay}$ is decay heat power, $A_i$ is initial activity of radionuclide i, $E_i$ is decay energy, $\lambda_i$ is decay constant, and $t$ is decay time.

  Physical significance: Activation product decay heat determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through post-shutdown thermal management and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) maintenance in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [neutronics](#neutronics) and radiological effects. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [neutron_activation_analysis](#neutron_activation_analysis), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through decay processes. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and safety planning.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Gamma spectroscopy measures activation product inventories. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate decay heat generation. Temperature monitoring tracks cooling rates. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses decay heat for safety assessments. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Decay heat 1-100 W/kg in first wall materials after shutdown, decreasing over days-weeks. JET: 0.1-10 W/kg depending on materials and operation time. DIII-D: 0.01-1 W/kg for various components. Heat decreases exponentially with decay time. Range across machines: 0.01-100 W/kg.

  Sign convention: Positive when decay heat indicates thermal power from radioactive decay of activation products in tokamak materials.
