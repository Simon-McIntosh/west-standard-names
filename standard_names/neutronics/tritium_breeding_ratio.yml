description: Ratio of tritium production to consumption in tokamak breeding blanket
  systems.
documentation: |-
  Tritium breeding ratio representing the efficiency of tritium production relative to consumption in tokamak breeding blanket systems. This ratio determines the sustainability of deuterium-tritium fusion fuel cycles, with ratios greater than 1.0 required for self-sufficient tritium supply. The breeding ratio depends on neutron spectra, blanket materials, and geometric configuration, making it crucial for fusion reactor design and operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$TBR = \frac{T_{produced}}{T_{consumed}} = \frac{\int \Phi_n \Sigma_{breeding} \, dV}{\frac{1}{4} n_D n_T \langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT} V_{plasma} \Delta t}$$

  where $TBR$ is tritium breeding ratio, $T_{produced}$ is tritium production rate, $T_{consumed}$ is tritium consumption rate, $\Phi_n$ is neutron flux, $\Sigma_{breeding}$ is macroscopic breeding cross-section, and $V_{plasma}$ is plasma volume.

  Physical significance: Tritium breeding ratio determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fuel sustainability and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) long-term operation in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [neutronics](#neutronics) and fuel cycle sustainability. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [d_t_fusion_reaction_rate](#d_t_fusion_reaction_rate) through fuel balance. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and fuel cycle planning.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate breeding performance. Tritium monitoring systems measure production and consumption rates. Material analysis determines breeding cross-sections. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses breeding data for fuel cycle assessment. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Target TBR 1.05-1.15 for self-sufficient operation with margin. JET: TBR not applicable (no breeding blanket). DIII-D: TBR not applicable. TBR > 1.0 required for sustainable operation. Range: 1.05-1.15 target range for ITER and future reactors.

  Sign convention: Positive when tritium breeding ratio indicates net tritium production exceeding consumption in breeding blanket systems.
