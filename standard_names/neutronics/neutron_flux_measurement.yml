description: Neutron flux measurement from fusion reactions in tokamak plasmas.
documentation: |-
  Neutron flux measurement representing the neutron emission rate from fusion reactions in magnetized plasmas. This measurement provides direct information on fusion reaction rates and plasma performance, with neutrons escaping the plasma nearly unattenuated and carrying information about the core fusion processes. Neutron flux is essential for monitoring fusion power and validating plasma performance in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$\Phi_n = \frac{1}{4} n_D n_T \langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT} V_{plasma} \frac{4\pi}{4\pi}$$

  where $\Phi_n$ is neutron flux, $n_D, n_T$ are deuterium and tritium densities, $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{DT}$ is D-T reaction rate coefficient, and $V_{plasma}$ is plasma volume.

  Physical significance: Neutron flux measurement determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through fusion monitoring and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) validation in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) and fusion reaction analysis. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density), and [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through reaction monitoring. Essential for [fusion_power_density](#fusion_power_density) measurement and reactor control.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Neutron detectors measure flux with high precision and time resolution. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate expected neutron production. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses neutron data for fusion power validation. Fast ion transport codes correlate with neutron measurements. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) optimization.

  Typical values: ITER: Neutron flux 10¹⁸-10²⁰ neutrons/m²s at full fusion power 500 MW. JET: 10¹⁵-10¹⁸ neutrons/m²s during high-power operations. DIII-D: 10¹²-10¹⁵ neutrons/m²s for studies. Energy 14.1 MeV for D-T reactions. Range across machines: 10¹²-10²⁰ neutrons/m²s.

  Sign convention: Positive when neutron flux indicates fusion reaction rate from deuterium-tritium reactions in the plasma.
