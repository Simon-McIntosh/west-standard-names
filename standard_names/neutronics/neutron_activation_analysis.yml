description: Analysis of neutron activation in tokamak materials and components.
documentation: |-
  Neutron activation analysis representing the process of measuring induced radioactivity in tokamak materials and components due to neutron bombardment. This analysis determines material activation levels, decay heat generation, and radiological hazards in fusion devices. Neutron activation is crucial for understanding material behavior, radiation safety, and component lifetime in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$A = \sigma \Phi_n N (1 - e^{-\lambda t})$$

  where $A$ is activation activity, $\sigma$ is activation cross-section, $\Phi_n$ is neutron flux, $N$ is target atom density, $\lambda$ is decay constant, and $t$ is irradiation time.

  Physical significance: Neutron activation analysis determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through material behavior and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) safety in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [neutronics](#neutronics) and radiation effects. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [activation_product_decay_heat](#activation_product_decay_heat) through activation processes. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and radiation safety.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: Gamma spectroscopy measures activation levels in materials. [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate activation rates and decay heat. Material analysis determines activation products. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses activation data for safety assessments. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Activation levels 10⁸-10¹² Bq/kg for structural materials after 1 MW-year operation. JET: 10⁶-10¹⁰ Bq/kg depending on materials. DIII-D: 10⁴-10⁸ Bq/kg for various components. Decay heat 1-100 W/kg after shutdown. Range across machines: 10⁴-10¹² Bq/kg.

  Sign convention: Positive when activation levels indicate induced radioactivity in materials due to neutron bombardment.
