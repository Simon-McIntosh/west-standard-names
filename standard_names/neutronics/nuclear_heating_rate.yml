description: Nuclear heating rate in tokamak materials from neutron and gamma interactions.
documentation: |-
  Nuclear heating rate representing the energy deposition in tokamak materials and components from neutron and gamma ray interactions. This heating results from nuclear reactions, scattering, and absorption processes that convert neutron and gamma energy to heat in structural materials, magnets, and shielding. Nuclear heating is crucial for thermal management and material response in tokamak operation.

  Governing equation:
  $$Q_n = \sum_i \Phi_n \cdot E_i \cdot \Sigma_{absorption,i} \cdot (1 - \eta_{leakage,i})$$

  where $Q_n$ is nuclear heating rate, $\Phi_n$ is neutron flux, $E_i$ is neutron energy for reaction i, $\Sigma_{absorption,i}$ is macroscopic absorption cross-section, and $\eta_{leakage,i}$ is energy leakage fraction.

  Physical significance: Nuclear heating rate determines [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) through thermal loading and directly affects [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design in tokamak operation. Critical for understanding [neutronics](#neutronics) and thermal effects. Strongly coupled to [neutronics](#neutronics), [plasma_performance](#plasma_performance), and [neutron_leakage_flux](#neutron_leakage_flux) through energy deposition. Essential for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) design and thermal management.

  Measurement/Calculation methods: [Neutronics](#neutronics) modeling codes calculate heating profiles. Temperature monitoring systems measure heating effects. Material analysis determines absorption properties. [Plasma_performance](#plasma_performance) analysis uses heating data for thermal assessments. Critical for [tokamak_scenario](#tokamak_scenario) planning.

  Typical values: ITER: Nuclear heating 0.1-1 MW/m³ in first wall, 0.01-0.1 MW/m³ in shield. JET: 0.01-0.1 MW/m³ in first wall during operations. DIII-D: 0.001-0.01 MW/m³ depending on configuration. Heating decreases with distance from plasma. Range across machines: 0.001-1 MW/m³.

  Sign convention: Positive when nuclear heating indicates energy deposition from neutron and gamma interactions in tokamak materials.
