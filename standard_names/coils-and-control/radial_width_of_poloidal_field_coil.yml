description: Horizontal full width (radial extent) of poloidal field coil rectangular
  cross-section.
documentation: 'Horizontal full width of the poloidal field coil element''s rectangular
  cross-section in the radial direction. This is the total radial extent of the coil
  conductor bundle, not the radius of individual turns.


  The cross-sectional area is given by:


  $$A_{coil} = w_{radial} \cdot h_{vertical}$$


  where $w_{radial}$ is this radial width and $h_{vertical}$ is the vertical height.
  This area, combined with the number of turns and current density, determines the
  total coil current capacity and thermal/mechanical constraints. Typical PF coil
  widths range from 0.05 to 0.5 meters. Used in electromagnetic force calculations
  and detailed coil modeling.'
