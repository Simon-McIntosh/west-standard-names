description: Induced current flowing in a passive axisymmetric conductor loop.
documentation: 'Current induced in a passive axisymmetric conducting loop by time-varying
  magnetic flux. Passive loops are non-connected conductors (distinct from active
  coil circuits) that respond to changing magnetic fields through electromagnetic
  induction.


  The induced current is governed by Faraday''s law and the loop resistance:


  $$V_{induced} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = I R$$


  $$I = -\frac{1}{R}\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$


  where $\Phi$ is the poloidal magnetic flux threading the loop, $R$ is the loop resistance,
  and $I$ is the resulting current. The sign convention follows the right-hand rule:
  positive current flows counter-clockwise when viewed from above.


  Passive loop currents provide stabilization against vertical displacement events
  and contribute to plasma position control. Time constants are determined by the
  loop inductance and resistance: $\tau = L/R$. Important for MHD stability analysis,
  disruption mitigation, and understanding electromagnetic coupling between plasma
  and conducting structures.'
