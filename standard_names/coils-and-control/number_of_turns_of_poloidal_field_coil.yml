description: Number of effective turns in a poloidal field coil element for calculating
  magnetic fields.
documentation: 'Number of effective turns in the poloidal field coil element, including
  the sign convention (positive for counter-clockwise current when viewed from above).
  This parameter is multiplied by the coil current to obtain the total magneto-motive
  force (MMF) producing the magnetic field:


  $$\text{MMF} = N \cdot I$$


  where $N$ is the number of turns and $I$ is the current per turn. The effective
  turn count may differ from the physical number of windings due to series/parallel
  connections or partial coil segments. Sign convention: positive turns indicate current
  flowing counter-clockwise when viewed from above (positive toroidal direction).
  Used in equilibrium reconstruction and coil current calculations.'
