description: Vertical full height of poloidal field coil rectangular cross-section.
documentation: |-
  Vertical full height of the poloidal field coil element's rectangular cross-section. This is the total vertical extent of the coil conductor bundle.

  The cross-sectional area is given by:

  $$A_{coil} = w_{radial} \cdot h_{vertical}$$

  where $w_{radial}$ is the radial width and $h_{vertical}$ is this vertical height. Larger cross-sections allow higher currents and better thermal performance but increase electromagnetic forces and structural loads. Typical PF coil heights range from 0.05 to 0.5 meters depending on coil function and machine size. This parameter is essential for accurate magnetic field modeling and structural analysis.
