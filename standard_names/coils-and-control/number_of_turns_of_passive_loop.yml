description: Effective number of turns in passive loop element for magnetic field
  calculations.
documentation: "Number of effective turns in the passive loop cross-section element\
  \ used for calculating magnetic fields. This value includes the sign of the number\
  \ of turns: positive indicates current flows counter-clockwise when viewed from\
  \ above (positive toroidal direction), negative indicates clockwise flow. The sign\
  \ convention follows the right-hand rule for current direction.\n\nThis parameter\
  \ is essential for relating induced currents to magnetic field contributions via\
  \ Amp\xE8re's law:\n\n$$\\mathbf{B}_{loop} = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{2\\pi r}$$\n\nwhere\
  \ $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the loop current, and $r$ is the distance from\
  \ the loop center. The effective turns account for the actual winding geometry and\
  \ any series/parallel connections in the loop structure.\n\nUsed in MHD equilibrium\
  \ reconstruction, passive stabilization analysis, and eddy current calculations\
  \ for passive conducting structures."
