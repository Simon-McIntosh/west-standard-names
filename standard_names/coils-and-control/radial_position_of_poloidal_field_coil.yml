description: Major radius (R coordinate) of poloidal field coil geometric center in
  cylindrical coordinates.
documentation: |-
  Radial coordinate (major radius R) of the poloidal field coil element geometric center in cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, φ). This defines the radial position of the rectangular or other cross-sectional coil geometry. Together with vertical_position_of_poloidal_field_coil and coil dimensions (width, height), this fully specifies the coil's spatial location for magnetic field calculations.

  Coil positions are critical inputs for equilibrium reconstruction codes (e.g., EFIT) and for calculating plasma-coil electromagnetic coupling. Position accuracy directly affects reconstruction quality and control system performance. Typical PF coil radii range from 0.5 to 10 meters depending on machine size.
