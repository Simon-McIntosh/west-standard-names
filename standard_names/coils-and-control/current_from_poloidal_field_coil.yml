description: Electric current flowing through a poloidal field coil (per turn).
documentation: 'Electric current flowing through one turn of the poloidal field coil.
  The total magneto-motive force (MMF) is obtained by multiplying by the number of
  turns:


  $$\text{MMF} = N \cdot I$$


  Sign convention: positive current flows from side 1 to side 2 inside the coil, corresponding
  to counter-clockwise direction when viewed from above (consistent with positive
  toroidal direction). This convention ensures consistency with right-hand rule for
  magnetic field direction.


  The magnetic field produced by the coil at a point is calculated using the Biot-Savart
  law:


  $$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{4\pi} \oint \frac{d\mathbf{l} \times
  (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r''})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r''}|^3}$$


  Typical PF coil currents range from 1 kA to 50 kA depending on machine size and
  coil function. Time-dependent measurements are used for equilibrium reconstruction,
  shape control, and plasma current evolution analysis.'
