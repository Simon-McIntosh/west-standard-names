description: Height (Z coordinate) of poloidal field coil geometric center in cylindrical
  coordinates.
documentation: "Vertical coordinate (height Z) of the poloidal field coil element\
  \ geometric center in cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, \u03C6). This defines the vertical\
  \ position of the rectangular or other cross-sectional coil geometry. Together with\
  \ radial_position_of_poloidal_field_coil and coil dimensions (width, height), this\
  \ fully specifies the coil's spatial location.\n\nVertical positioning is especially\
  \ important for shaping coils and vertical stability control. PF coil heights typically\
  \ span from below the divertor region to above the upper X-point, ranging from -3\
  \ to +3 meters (machine dependent). Position accuracy affects plasma shape control\
  \ and equilibrium reconstruction fidelity."
