description: Electric current flowing through a poloidal field coil (per turn).
documentation: |-
  Current flowing through a poloidal field coil (PF coil).

  Sign convention: Positive when generating magnetic field in positive $Z$ direction on axis (upward). PF coils control plasma vertical position, shape, and provide inductive drive. Current magnitude and timing determine flux swing, ramp-up capability, and equilibrium configuration. Used in equilibrium reconstruction and real-time control systems.
