name: passive_loop_current
description: Induced current flowing in a passive axisymmetric conductor loop.
documentation: |-
  Current induced in a passive conducting loop or structure by time-varying magnetic fields.

  Sign convention: Positive when generating magnetic field opposing the change in flux through the loop (Lenz's law, stabilizing direction). Passive loops provide eddy current stabilization for vertical displacement events and resistive wall modes. Current magnitude depends on loop resistance, inductance, and rate of flux change. Important for MHD stability and disruption mitigation.
